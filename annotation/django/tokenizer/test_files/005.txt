It's been a long time since I saw this stat, so I can't give the source, but if you google Risperdal you may find it. When my son started in Risperdal for Tourette's tics back 8 years ago, the question was asked of clinicians what they saw in their practices vis a vis Risperdal. The response was that over 80% of the ASD kids on Risperdal improved significantly. I seem to remember they were mainly looking at aggresson or self-injury. Risperdal is the only drug approved SPECIFICALLY for use with ASD kids because there has been such success. Even the 54% number is amazingly high. The biggest and most immediate side-effect is significant weight gain in the vast majority of patients. However, no one gets kicked out of school for being fat. Risperdal not only took care of my son's severe tics, but it got him back on track when the hormones present at puberty made him very aggressive.


I have one word of caution, though. Your son is LITTLE. If there has not been a FUnctional Behavioral Assessment done and a positive Behavior Intervention Plan put in place, I'd do that FIRST, before any drugs are tried. Call an IEP meeting and ask for a BCBA.
