Get a different psych. Even none at all would be better than anyone who would put a young child on Haldol.

I have had one of the most severe kind of reactions to Haldol that I've heard of anyone having and surviving. But I knew other kids who were on Haldol and had to stay on it. They were supposedly on other drugs to control the effect it had on their bodies, but they could not move right. At all. Their jaws clenched shut and they stuck their fingers in their mouths to try to pry their teeth apart to keep them from grinding. They sometimes fell asleep standing up. Haldol is a high-potency neuroleptic and as far as I can tell that entire kind of neuroleptics is more toxin than medication.
