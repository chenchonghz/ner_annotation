hi all....well, I finally took the dive, and started my 10 year old son on risperdal....It's something that I really didn't want do, and have been putting it off for some time now....his behaviors were escalating to the point that we were isolated at home, and the school was going to resort to somewhat physical aversives....so something HAD to be done....


I still don't know if going the medication route is the right way to go....sometimes I think that my son's behaviors spiraled so much in the past few months because of a control issue at school (behaviors are more frequent there)....


So we went to his neurologist, and she witnessed his behaviors, and felt that risperdal may be the only thing that will work....


Well, it's only been 4 days now...and let me tell you all, it has CHANGED him....he's sleeping ALL night for the first time in 10 years!!! He only had 3 behaviors yesterday, where it would normally be 20 times at home a day (and 95 times a day at school)...he's calmer, less "stimmy", and I think without his brain racing full speed ahead all day, the HE feels better....he seems drowsy, and a little pale, but I think as his body adjusts, those will pass...he's on a low dose...


I do feel guilty...I just wonder if I would have put him on it at all if the school would have handled his behaviors appropriately....or given him "replacement behaviors" for the negative ones...but we are beyond that now.....I just hope that I did the right thing for my son.....he's minimally verbal, so he can't tell me how he's feeling... I have to judge by behaviors....
