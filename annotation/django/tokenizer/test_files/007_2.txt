My son is a 4-1/2 year old boy diagnosed with PDD-NOS. Among his otherchallenges, he has serious attention deficit issues as well as hyperactivity (needs to touch things and me a lot of the time), and physical aggression towards other kids at school. We were told by a child neurologist professor who specializes in cases of ASD to put him on risperdal, starting with 1/2 cc and if there'sno improvement after 3-4 weeks to increase the dosage to 1 cc. He said that if needed, ritilin may be added to the risperdal at a later time - maybe in 3 months, when he'll have his follow-up appointment. We began him on the medication two days ago, even though wewere and remainreluctant. We also have him on Omega 3 with a vit. e supplement for over a month now, but have so far seen no changes. I'm interested in hearing from anyone who has had experience withrisperdal.
