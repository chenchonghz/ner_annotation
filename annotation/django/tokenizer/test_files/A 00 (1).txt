Well I'm here. 
Original tumour Feb 2009 showed a small amount of Her2 so I did a year of Herceptin after full on chemo and rads. 
Subsequent tumours and nodes have all been TN. 
Was on Xeloda for a while but had progression, so am now on Abraxane which is hopefully keeping it at bay for a while. 
My sister is also TN and just finished her year of chemo and rads. We will investigate the genetic stuff soon. 
I love to hear about current research into TN. I know they are trying to make it a priority but we do hear so much about the hormonal stuff. 
Cheers 
Angela
