As long as the yeast is under control, then med-free is fine...ALA increases yeast but is so good to pull metals out of the brain...  Nystatin is a prescription but we were not successful with herbs...strong probiotics don't work for him but he responds very well to compunded Nystatin...I tried Culturelle for a time and he couldn't tolerate it...I have tried other ones that have multi-strains and his bowels get too loose...I have found one that seems to work well from Sedona Labs....I-Flora...he still can only tolerate maybe 1/3 capusle per day!!!  We have been working on biomed treatment for 2.5 yrs before using Nystatin and 3.5 yrs before starting chelation....it is such a long process!!!!- Mom to 14 yr old boy (Aspie, ADHD/OCD/ODD/RAD/Seizures) and 7 yr old boy (ASD - possibly PDD)
