My DS was in a study at Kansas University this fall . It was measuring the levels of oxytocin in the blood of kids age 4-5 ( boy and girls ) vs. `` normal '' kids . The University got a grant from CAN to test this . This is from the CAN site ... . The effects of oxytocin on immune function may be as important as its role in social affiliation , for which it originally received attention in autism research . Oxytocin functions in conjunction with G-proteins as a signaling neuropeptide , with effects on immune function . This study will investigate whether young children with autism have aberrant oxytocin levels in blood , if their G-proteins are abnormal , and if gender differences in oxytocin expression result in varying levels of immune response . The investigators suspect that increased Oxytocin action in the limbic system may `` protect '' girls from autism . The study will also explore whether abnormal oxytocin levels are associated with immune activation and altered cytokines , shedding light on possible immunological mechanisms that may relate to social function and autism .
