Welcome! I hope you get a lot of good insights here. I have found it to be helpful. I don't know whether it's related to the autism or not, but I have noticed the same thing with my son for the past several years. I bathe him regularly and he uses antiperspirant a couple of times a day, has good hygiene. No noticeable scent on him normally, but yes, his room....If I do skip a bath for him, it isn't just a strong scent, it quickly becomes an unpleasant odor on him! I personally have thought it may be his diet, because he prefers lots of carbs and tomato/garlic/herb based foods...ok, pizza and spaghetti, I'm busted...lol. He does eat other things, but it seems he gravitates to his faves and I give in too often. He has now entered the wonderful world of puberty...so far though, it hasn't worsened, may even be a little better. This probably wasn't much help, but thought I'd share.  - Mom of 2: 18, NT and 13, ASD  He says I'm his "best Mom"
