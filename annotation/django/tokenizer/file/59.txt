My dh gets the flu shots every year from his job and gets sick every year. None of my kids gets the flu shot because their dr. only orders the ones without mercury for babies. At your childs age they should have given him the Thimersol free shot. Chance are he will be fine but I would have been very angry.  I was also under the impression that the flu shot should not be given until October.
