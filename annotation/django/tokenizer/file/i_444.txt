I totally agree with Ken It is best to have the body make its own glutathione ; All hormones , including small peptide with specific functions , are strictly regulated by body . The mechanism used for regulation is Negative feedback inhibition . When the end product of a pathway ( like GSH ) is too high , the product ( GSH ) will negatively inhibit the flow of the pathway so it produces less product . So when external GSH is administrated , it will slow down or even shut down body 's ability to make GSH . All hormones are regulated the same way , and that 's why those baseball players taking drugs will go turkey and stop function when they stop taking them . They body lost most of ability to make these hormones . The following is from http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione : Raising GSH levels through direct supplementation of glutathione is difficult . Research suggests that glutathione taken orally is not well absorbed across the gastrointestinal tract . Glutathione is a tightly regulated intracellular constituent , and is limited in its production by negative feedback inhibition of its own synthesis through the enzyme gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase , thus greatly minimizing any possibility of overdosage . Glutathione augmentation using presursors of glutathione synthesis or intravenous glutathione is a strategy developed to address states of glutathione deficiency , high oxidative stress , immune deficiency , and xenobiotic overload in which glutathione plays a part in the detoxification of the xenobiotic in question ( especially through the hepatic route ) .
