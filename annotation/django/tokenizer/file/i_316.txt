My ds had the same problem when I started supplementing calcium . He had a hair test that showed his was very low , almost off the chart , so I had to find some way to supplement it . Our problem turned out to be the form of calcium . Calcium carbonate made him so constipated the only way to get him to have a bm was to give him an enema . ./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif I switched to using calcium citrate and we do n't have this problem anymore . I also give his magnesium in the citrate form . That seems to have fixed the problem for us . I give him 900 mg calcium citrate a day now with no problems . HTH
