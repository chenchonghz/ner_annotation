My 7 yr. old son was recenlty treated by the ILS system due to sensory intergration problems coupled with severe hyperactivity . He had been taking risperdol for about a year and the threpay was promising . He submitted to a urine screen of his neurotransmitters and it showed , noropinephrien , high , dopamine is high , histamine is elevated , Glutamine is elevated , Glycine is elevated and Taurine is low . We discontinued the risperdol due to the success of the ILS therapy , and began regmients of calmPRX , Kavinace , TravaCor , and Endotrex for the previous week . He seems to be having an adverse effect to these neurotransmitter meds as his behavior has became unbearable , he is unable to be calm , keep from moving , etc . He acts as if he is coming out of his skin and cant regain control . Does anyone have any stories pertaining to these reactions to the meds ... Please , any suggestions are welcome . We are desperate , you may e-mail directly at woodall3927 @ yahoo.com Thanks in advance .
