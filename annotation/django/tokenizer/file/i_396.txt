The interesting thing about phosphatidylserine ( PS ) is that a portion of the molecule is water soluble with the remainder fat soluble ( i.e . the fatty acids ) . Thus , on the surface there does n't appear to be any advantage for the supplement to be in a softgel vs. a powder . Bovine PS , fish PS ( e.g . Sharp thought ) , and human PS are all very similar in that one tail of the PS molecule contains DHA and the other one is rich in stearic and oleic acids . Soy derived PS does not contain any DHA , but contains the omega-6 linoleic acid in one tail and the other one is rich in palmitic acid . Thus , the soy PS is much different than human PS . It is clear that human cells/neurons will not incorporate the soy PS directly in their membranes ( nor would you want them to ) . Thus , the soy PS is useless as is . The soy PS molecule must first be broken down into smaller components before it can be utilized ( requiring sufficient amount of digestive enzymes ) . About 20 % of soy PS is a phosphorylated serine which is the rate limiting factor ( along with DHA ) for the body to make its own human PS ( with DHA tails ) . It is difficult to see any advantage that a soy PS has over Seriphos ( available as a capsule ) . Seriphos is already a Phosphorylated Serine without the fatty acids and glycerol ( glycerol is very abundant in the body ) . It is easily absorbed , does not require enzymes to break it down and is available for use by cells to make PS . It is questionable whether even bovine PS or fish derived PS can be directly incorporated into cell membranes . If they too are first broken down and reassembled to get the proper proportion of fatty acids , then there is no clear benefit to Sharp Thought ( i.e . it may just be a much more expensive version ) . With either the soy PS or Seriphos you must not be deficient in the DHA omega-3 fatty acid for them to be effective .
