My son turned a corner from the very first dose of NDF Plus . He has been improving ever since . I stopped NDF Plus for a few months once he started TD DMSA and then the nasal MB12 , but I found that his behaviors returned and I had to get him back on NDF Plus . I have said it before and I will say it again ./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif without NDF Plus my son would not be in the first grade classroom he would be in the special ed room alone , he would not be interacting with friends he would be feared and viewed as the boy who hits and shoves , he would not be reading , writing , spelling , doing math and attending gym , he would be working on sitting , holding his pencil long enough to write his name , and how to toss a ball back and forth with his aid in an empty gym . NDF Plus has allowed my son the patience to sit , comply , learn , interact , communicate , watch a movie , play a board game , wait in line , sit through lunch without roaming . Everything my son takes has gotten him to this point , but I can honestly say , that without the NDF Plus he would not have made it this far . Everything he takes is healing him , but the NDF Plus seems to make him comfortable in his own skin , calms him , makes him *feel* healthy and happy and seems to lift the brain fog and confusion . Also taking : calcium/magnesium zinc vitamin C with bioflavonoids vitamin E vanadium CoQ10 taurine methionine selenium glycine CLO Ultimate Omega candida clear , yeast defense , gse in rotation probiotic melatonin diflucan valtrex TD DMSA B-complex aloe juice trinity water NDF Plus Liver Life milk thistle zyme prime beta glucan Hope this helps ... . _________________ Dana
