Our Son is now being chelating with IV ( not push in ) and has started showing improvement in language and receptively . Receptive always was very difficult for our son so we are especially pleased to see this as well . He is also on the GF/CF diet , supplements , MB12 shots daily , and back on HBOT after a month off . We are not sure if the regression in language is due to the actos or off the HBOT . His language was much better when doing the HBOT as he pretty much immediately picked up in his language . The receptive was always the more difficult piece but we see such an improvement with the IV CHelation . First time on the actos so just wondering as all I have heard about actos as some kids had some to a great amount of weight gain . Thanks for any comments/advise you can share on this .
