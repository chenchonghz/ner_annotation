having had lots of questions of late regarding yeast and supplements we have just recently started experimenting with and now at chelation for 2.5 months i believe i am seeing his first regression , meaning bigger full blown , we have had at times little back slides . is this a good thing or bad ? on other protocals this is talked about as a good sign , my other son did the valtrex protocal and had some regression but nothing like this little one is experiencing . i gave him some activated charcol last week when things were starting , like the die off reactions and such . then today he needed it again as the sillies and the amount he was needing to put pressure on his head by pushing into my face and forehead and slamming himself down on the bed . i am using so many things for yeast and his GI is fine one day of red anus which was releived quickly with GSE so am determining it is something else , especially as the AC didnt really bring on any relief either . being gfcf now for 6.5 years i think it may have been the barley in the PD . though it did wonders for his gut and his attending and speech were much improved too before this attack , i know now the need to keep him totally gfcf . i have switched probiotics but i dont believe it will be as good as the PD , the whole soil organisms are what make it different from other brands . is there a comparable brand that truely is gfcf ? if it is a gfcf reaction how long will it last ? if it is yeast or redistribution of metals in the brain what can we do for that ? we are on ALA cutler protocal and NCD again seeing great things with these products too so dont want to have to stop to do another chelation protocal which may bring the same thing anyway . anyone with experience or advice i would sure appreciate it , thanks . _________________ Lisalynn keeping hope and faith through it all .
