i spoke with the pharmacist at lee silsby yesterday and he told me that some children are taking much larger doses at enhansa than the recommended 600 mg , but that it takes months to get there and should be done slowly . our boy is 34 lbs . and he said he could go up to even 1200-1800 mg. i think we will definitely be trying to inch him up over the next few months . i 'd really like to go to just enhansa and get our son off of valtrex , but we 've only been doing valtrex for two months , so i think we will give it more time . but , conceivably , could n't enhansa do the same thing as valtrex ? i feel like our guy 's little burst at an attempt at language has kind of faded out , but he 's still making great progress and all of a sudden he is pointing at things and identifying pictures , etc . we are currently at 600 mg. split into two doses . we 've been at this dosage for a week now .
