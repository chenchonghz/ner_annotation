He developed a patch ( about 3/4 '' ) of dry skin on his thigh a while back . I stopped applying LDN to that area thinking it would go away but it has been over two months and it is still there . It is red , itchy and dry . I also noticed in two other spots where I rotate LDN skin is raised and has little bumps . Is it related to the medication or is he reacting to the base in any way ? Have you had anybody have a similar problem with LDN ? What should I put on it ? Thanks a lot , Hi Lily , It would be best to give me a call at 1-800-918-8831 to discuss this .
