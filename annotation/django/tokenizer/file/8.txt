You are right. Those were all good views on it. When doing research (from my own opinion) I don't know that I would take the risk. It is without a doubt a controversial treatment. If you look into it tho no chelation therapy of any form is FDA approved for treating autism. I'm not sure that uncertain benefits are a good enough reason to put a child thru the risks.  Have you done regular blood work to see any changes? are you 100% sure that the treatments is whats making the difference?
