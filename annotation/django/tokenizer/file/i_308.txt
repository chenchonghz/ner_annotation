Absorption rate for suppository is way much higher than TD . Zoe Hi Zoe , thanks for your reply . My son will turn 5 this August . We started chelation last December . After 1st round of DMSA supp. , he went crazy for a month ./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif bed-wetting every night , lots of stim ... etc . I guess it 's the yeast . So we stopped for a month and now we have finished 8 rounds of DMSA supp . The DMSA supp pulled out a lot of LEAD at the beginning but not much Mercury . We recently did a porphyrin test and it shows that my son has `` noticeable mercury toxin effect ... '' . And so we are thinking if we should do a provocation test on DMPS supp to see if that can help to pull out more Mercury . Are you doing DMSA supp and DMPS supp alternately or one after the other ? My son is not talking yet ... he has a lot of words , single words but he is not using them for communicatiion..
