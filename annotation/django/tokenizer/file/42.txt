Hi Julie We took Mega minerals daily from BRAINCHILD and I paid extra to get zinc added into the EDTA (glutathione and vitamin C is part of the IV as well). I wish I did hair test, but at that time the doctor and I werent sure about the hair test. We werent sure that it will give accurate result so we didnt do it. Plus it was so many things to do and changing the diet - everything was chaos. He was 3 at that time and it's been a year cleaning up his guts from bacteria and yeast. I have appt. with the doctor next month, I will find out what she is going to say. I do notice from last UTM that the the amount of Lead, Mercury and Aluminum increased - this means something came out from his body and this is a good start. I really appreciate your input/thoughts/advice. Please keep me posted if you found out about chelations (bad thing and good thing) THank you !! Jiti
