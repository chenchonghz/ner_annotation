Hi Lisa You said you think your ds is smart and autistic , I am hearing that a lot actually . Being smart can mask or take the attention away from the autistic symptoms to a certain degree especially if you dont see the child with peers . This is a quote from Autism answer Quote : Children with autistic type behavior have often been described as exceedingly intelligent , even to the extreme point of being considered savants in particular areas . Dr. Tsien and his collaborators have demonstrated a correlation between glutamate receptors and superior ability in learning and memory . By overproducing a component of one of the glutamate receptors they were able to increase the level of glutamate binding . This was the first demonstration of a relationship between increased glutamate/glutamate receptors and higher intelligence . The down side of the enhanced level of glutamate was an increased risk of stroke and seizure activity . This work suggests a potential correlation between intelligence and glutamate levels . It also points to the potential increased susceptibility to excitotoxin damage due to excess glutamate/glutamate receptor activity as a consequence of enhanced intelligence . My son will be 4 in April , when he was 18 months old he knew the alphabet , could count to 10 - obsessed with letters and numbers , had extreme tantrums if things did n't go his way , had extreme oral sensitivities and other texture sensitivities , went from uninterested in other kids to actively aggressive . He was dx as aspergers in August .
