Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) and several other neurological disorders have been linked to the overactivation of glutamatergic transmission and excitotoxicity as a common pathway of neuronal injury . The beta-amyloid peptide ( Abeta ) is centrally related to the pathogenesis of AD , and previous reports have demonstrated that the blockade of glutamate receptors prevents Abeta-induced neuronal death . We show that taurine , a beta-amino acid found at high concentrations in the brain , protects chick retinal neurons in culture against the neurotoxicity of Abeta and glutamate receptor agonists . The protective effect of taurine is not mediated by interaction with glutamate receptors , as demonstrated by binding studies using radiolabeled glutamate receptor ligands . The neuroprotective action of taurine is blocked by picrotoxin , an antagonist of GABA ( A ) receptors . GABA and the GABA ( A ) receptor agonists phenobarbital and melatonin also protect neurons against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity . These results suggest that activation of GABA receptors decreases neuronal vulnerability to excitotoxic damage and that pharmacological manipulation of the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter tonus may protect neurons against a variety of insults . GABAergic transmission may represent a promising target for the treatment of AD and other neurological disorders in which excitotoxicity plays a relevant role .
