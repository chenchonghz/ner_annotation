In case anyone interested in actual science . http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18461502 Abstract Reduced folate transport to the CNS was identified in two autism spectrum disorders , i.e. , Rett syndrome and infantile low-functioning autism with neurological abnormalities . Twenty-five patients with early-onset low-functioning autism with or without neurological deficits , were evaluated for serum folate , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) 5-methyltetrahydrofolate ( 5MTHF ) , and serum FR autoantibodies of the blocking type to determine the significance of folate receptor ( FR ) autoantibodies with respect to folate transport across the blood-CSF barrier . In spite of normal serum folate , CSF 5MTHF was low in 23 of 25 patients . The reduced CSF folate in 19 of these 23 patients could be explained by serum FR autoantibodies blocking the folate binding site of the membrane-attached FR on the choroid epithelial cells . Oral folinic acid supplements led to normal CSF 5MTHF and partial or complete clinical recovery after 12 months . Serum FR autoimmunity appears to represent an important factor in the pathogenesis of reduced folate transport to the nervous system among children with early-onset low-functioning autism associated with or without neurological deficits . Early detection of FR autoantibodies may be a key factor in the prevention and therapeutic intervention among this subgroup of patients with autism . _________________ the old mommyjen ~ M o m m y t o 5 w o n d e r f u l k i d s ~
