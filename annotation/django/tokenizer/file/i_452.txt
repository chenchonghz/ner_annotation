alberta got me going on the riboflavin ( phosphate 5 ) version , and now it turns out a deficiency in this is key to people with c677t mutations . If you go into pubmed and type a search for c677t and riboflavin , you find a bunch of studies showing that women with bone fractures and c677t have low riboflavin levels , and people with various cancers and c677t have low riboflavin ... and so on . So B2 ( R5P , especially ) , seems to be really critical . He also has VERY high glutaric acid and other markers for PKU , but does n't seem to HAVE PKU ( phenylketonuria ) . It turns out that riboflavin helps to LOWER excess glutaric acid . This is such a tangled web . _________________ Getting rid of mold in our home improved behavior
