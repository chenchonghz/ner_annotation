BUMP ! ! I was reading this long chain all night since I was reading some good things about luteolin . By my count , 15 people in this thread have tried it , 10 people said they were keeping it ( 2 were even WOW'ed ) , 4 had a bad reaction , and the last post here I 'm counting as a maybe . I would say it sounds promising . Anyone else tried it ? I 'm also hoping the people who posted that they were staying on luteolin in this thread can give us an update too . Thanks ! -Kara PS - http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2396685/ -- - Thus , luteolin is a promising agent for preventing and treating neuroinflammation mediated by the JNK and AP-1 signaling pathway , and it may be useful for mitigating a dysregulated linkage between the immune system and brain . I am one of those who believes Autism is n't so much a Brain Disorder but more of an Autoimmune Disorder that effects the brain .
