I do n't think with enhansed curcumin ( enhansa ) we are getting more than 600 mg , it just has to do with how much is absorbed . From what I read , if we just want to use it to kill off intestinal yeast the regular curcumin is fine . It does n't have to be absorbed to work in the intestines , ha ha . In fact , it may work better on yeast that way because it just stays there and moves on through . We started with regular curcumin and killed off yeast and it worked great . I wanted enhansed curcumin after learning higher absorption rates are good as an anti-inflamatory , anti-viral , anti-bacterial ( reason not to give it within an hour of probiotics ) , anti-cancer , and it also works to break down something ( some protein , I think ) that has accumulated in the brains of alzheimer 's patients to help reverse it . So for just yeast I think regular over-the-counter curcumin would do the trick but for the other benefits it would have to have the higher absorption to get into the bloodstream . Maybe some of these kiddos are allergic to the root portion used to enhance the curcumin ? Too much time on my hands , obviously . ./images/smilies/icon_lol.gif
