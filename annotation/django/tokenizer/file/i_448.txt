Thanks everyone ! ! ! Tatum is 6.5 and 50lbs . I have done 6rds so far that went like this : 1-Fri/sat/sun 3mg dmsa 8/3/10 saw a little improvement in speech . 2-same but @ 4.5mg was definitely talking more per preschool on Mon . Week off due to stomach bug-first time she caught anything from school ! 3-Tues/wed/thrs 5mg same time . Day 2 had a crying spell BUT was able to say I 'm sad for the 1st time . 4-next w/e @ 6mg added adrenal cortex , no crying , great mood ! More speech , more play with lil sister , awesome ! Little silly though.5-treating yeast with nystatin gse tablets , all good in 2 days back to 6mg 3d a day another w/e . 6-still using AC and watching yeast , another rd at 6mg doing fine and changed dosing to every 4hrs during day ( 715-1115-315-715 ) . I 'd rather do this than inc the 6mg at once . Thinking of adding ala soon . Small gains each time , treat yeast , watch adrenals . I pooled everything I learned and just decided to try this and see how she does . She hates the need and reacted horribly the 1st time I tried to wake her up . Since chelation , she no longer needs oxypowder daily to poop or melatonin to sleep . She is def having awesome days on rd , a little yeasty a few days after but easy to knock out , and just a happier kid . She is commenting on classmates now ( so and so is asleep , so and so is crying , etc ) I love my private aba preschool even though they do not support or give credit to any form of biomedical due to the lack of evidence . Tatum is my evidence . Tatum clears up all of my AC protocol , Dan protocol , yeast management , therapy issues ... ..when I 'm patient and give her time . I listened to the warning of the AC folks about the high Dan dose . But I went with the AC dose and the Dan dosing schedule and tweaked it from there . I will ck her liver and various blood tests soon and hopefully confirm that this is the best thing we have ever done . Thanks to everyone , AC and Dan , that have given advice and support !
