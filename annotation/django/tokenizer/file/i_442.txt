Thanks Yes , Tylenol , acetaminophen and paracetamol are all the same thing and Motrin is just the brand name for ibuprofen . I suspect ibuprofen is much safer for kids ( with respect to ASD anyway ) . In a recent study of children who experienced an adverse reaction to the MMR vaccine , children treated with acetaminophen were found to be 6 times more likely to develop an autism spectrum disorder when compared to similar children who were treated with ibuprofen . pvgv ( http : //www.autismrecoveryprogram.com ) _________________ pvgv www.autismrecoveryprogram.com
