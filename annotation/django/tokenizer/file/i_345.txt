Check out this article from Metamatrix Labs . I was shocked when I read this article , because my son has had low creatinine levels on multiple urine and serum tests . I assume that means the results should be thrown out ? http : //www.metametrix.com:80/content/Le ... s/422.html `` In order to assure urine specimen adequacy , creatinine is used as a benchmark for urinary analyte concentration . Creatinine must be above 30mg/dl in order for test results to have meaning and be reflective of `` true '' ranges . Creatinine in most adults falls around 100 mg/dl and in a child around 75mg/dl . However , as long as a creatinine of 30mg/dl is achieved , test results are reliable . ''
