[ quote= MomToC M ] Wondering if I should up it to 25mg next weekend or stay at 12.5mg for a while longer . Cole 's 84 pounds , so this dose is really low for him . *****For kids 8 older , you need 10 rounds to tell . It 's not recommended to raise the dose for at least 5 rounds as the rounds are accumulative . It 's recommended to only raise by 50 % , no more and in my experience , 5 or so mgs raise is plenty . *** I have n't been treating for yeast yet except for 2 Candidase in the AM and VSL3 and/or Culturelle before bed . Maybe I 'll just do the Brainchild program so it 's all explained to me . ****Check out Grapefruit seed extract . Do n't rotate antifungals , it makes the yeast more resistant ( in direct opposition to Dan ! protocol , I know ) . I know some get away with rotating , but I 've known some not to and you can get in a real mess this way .
