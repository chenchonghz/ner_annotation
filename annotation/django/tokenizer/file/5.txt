ya know , jeeze , in 3 days I have gotton 8 hrs of sleep , thats bad , I went to bed at 5:30am and woke at 7:30 , and now its 8:25 and even after taking a sleeping pill im on here and feeling unusually energetic ... ill crash at work , great cause I work overtime tonight and have to do more travel then usuall . Anyways , apparently Joe Rogan was at a tailgate party and admitted to someone that everyday he swallows tons of vitamins and suppliments , ALOT ! Definatly not healthy , they need to get rid of him and put that guy who played Doug Heffernan on the king of queens on instead hes also a fighter plus hes alot funnier . He goes to every fight , ive also seen David Spade , Linnel Riches daughter , hmm ... who else ... well I cant think , lots of celebs go to these events and I wish I could too.- DX'ed with HFA as a child . Nowdays what I have would be called AS .
