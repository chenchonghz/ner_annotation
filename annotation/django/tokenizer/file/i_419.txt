Thank you for sharing your positive experience , My Dan ! doctor ( Dr Rossignol ) had suggested it for my almost non-verbal daughter , to improve speech , and I was a bit anxious about it , but now I 'll give it a try . He had suggested first high doses of Acetyl-L-carnitine ( 2000 mg a day , in two doses ) and carnosine ( 800mg , in 2 doses ) , plus p-5-p , 100mg a day ( have n't tried yet ) and DMG . I have implemented the ALC and carnosine , and I 'm working on the p5p , but no great improvements , as far as I can see , only from those two . He had suggested galantamine , 4mg twice a day , if the previous supplements were ineffective , so I think it 's time I give it a try . My daughter is 6 1/2 and weights 55 pounds/23kg , she is epileptic and the Dan ! doc had prescribed some supplements ( Carnosine , taurine , DMG ) also because of their anti-seizure properties . He did not say anything about galantamine possibly causing seizures . Another medication we tried at his request was spironolactone , and man , it did have a huge impact at first , my daughter started to say mama almost the first day that we started it . but the effect seems to have diminished after the first month or so , and now she still say mama and daddy , but , after 3 months we have not gone beyond that . She is supposed to be on spironolactone for 1 year . before that we had tried Actos and had some benefit from that too , albeit not on speech , mostly on cognition . My daughter is also double positive at the Anne Connolly test , that found she has antibodies to brain endothelial cells , a form of autoimmunity ... .and indeed , while she seems to have a fairly good IQ , language acquisition has a been huge problem for her .
