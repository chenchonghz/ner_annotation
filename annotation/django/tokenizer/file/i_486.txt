Quote : What is the effect of Valproic Acid on focus ? That 's quite difficult to answer for me : my son was given Valproate by a psychiatrist for mood stabilisation as the primary reason . I do n't remember any cognitive effects of this treatment , negative or positive . However the most important thing then was to help my son with his recurrent episodes of severe mood issues . Valproate was not the only intervention , so I am not sure what helped . Only after several months it turned out that the mood episodes were very bad headaches , which my son was not able to communicate then . Valproate may have been effective for his headaches as it 's given also for migraine prophylaxis . I saw cognitive improvement in my son , including focus , when he was weaned off therapeutic doses of Valproate , but at the same time we started Bumetanide and in fact it was this drug that caused real progress . Sleep EEG is still abnormal in my son though . How is your treatment with Bacopa and other compounds you mentioned ? They are something new to me .
