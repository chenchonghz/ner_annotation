We 've been using OSR since the end of Jan . It has been a part of a multipronged approach including Chlorella , OSR , TTFD GSH creams and ion footbaths . We 've seen improvements in verbal communication , initiation and willingness to try new different things , but we 've also seen some regression in play skills and stimming . I 've realized that I can only do the TTFD and GSH a few times a week otherwise her system gets overloaded . Once I back off the stimming decreases . Yeast is always a concern for us ( despite SCD ) , so we are on Diflucan and just doubled our dose to 200mg to help deal with a flare up . This is helping . _________________ Mom to Rosie , 7yrs - ASD Long Island , NY
