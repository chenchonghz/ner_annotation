I received it the same day too , check your spam file , for some reason the activation message went to my spam file . I am too using GABA 500 mg 3xday . My kid is 9 years old , it sure helped with sleep , but ca n't see improvement in his speech . I will try to increase the dose , will see . Dr. Yasko also was talking about lowering the Glutamate level to keep the balance between Glutamate and GABA , this was a new info for me , so maybe we should look into watching the glutamate issue now . There is a list of foods contain glutamate , i will search for it , let you know . good luck . _________________ Thank you Monica
