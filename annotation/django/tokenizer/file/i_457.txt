Hi Wondering if anyone can help me try to understand the significance and best course of action from my son 's OATs results . Our ASD Biomedical Specialist has proposed strong antibiotics for a suspected stomach virus ( based on these results ) and a very restricted diet which we would like to avoid if possible , especially as our son is only just turning 3 . It is the GAPS diet , which is very high in protein , which both of his parents find very difficult to digest , and so would not like to put him on this . A dietician who works closely with him thinks we should do this diet , but thinks that if we do n't , strong probiotics ( like VSL # 3 ) might do the job very slowly over a very long period . Does anyone have any thoughts on this , or is anyone able to throw any light on it by looking at the test results below ? These were the high markers in the test : Yeast/Fungal : Arabinose ( 5 times upper end of normal range ) Malabsorption/Bacterial : Oxalic ( almost tripple upper end of normal range ) Succini ( more than double upper end of normal range ) 4-Hydroxybenzoic and 4-Hydroxyhippuric ( 10 % and 50 % above upper end of normal range ) HPHPA ( Clostridia Marker ) ( 25 % above upper end of normal range ) Hippuric ( 15 % above upper end of normal range ) Succini ( more than double upper end of normal range ) Glycolytic Cycle Metabolites : Lactic ( nearly double upper end of normal range ) Krebs Cycle Metabolites : Succinic ( more than double upper end of normal range ) Nurotransmitter Metabolites VMA ( slightly above upper end of normal range ) Quinolinic ( slightly above upper end of normal range - and very high Quinolinic/5-HIAA ratio ) Ketone Fatty Acid Oxidation Methylsuccinic ( double upper end of normal range ) Suberic ( nearly double upper end of normal range ) Sebacic ( nearly double upper end of normal range ) Adipic ( about 20 % above upper end of normal range ) Indicators of Detoxification 2-Hydroxyhippuric ( more than 5 times upper end of normal range ) Pyroglutamic ( about 35 % above upper end of normal range ) Amino Acid Metabolites 2-Hydroxyhippuric ( 1.3 times upper end of normal range ) 3-Methylglutaric ( more than 1.5 times upper end of normal range )
