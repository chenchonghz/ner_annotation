Just remember that babies and young children need fats for brain development and vitamin absorption , especially if they are off whole milk . I am a little concerned about your list Holly . Jair and Lia especially need good fats and the only thing I saw on your list was olive oil . If your kids are n't allergic to peanut butter ( without trans fats ) that can be good . I am taking Liam off dairy but plan to give him red meat , nuts , avacados , and eggs with yolks . Your plan looks great for adults . Here is a link about fats and kids . http : //lowfatcooking.about.com/od/faqs/f/lowfatkids.htm- ~Julie~ Liam ( 2 years 4 months )
