CD does not function like Oxygen . Some knowledge on how and why CD works is here : http : //mmswiki.org/index.php ? title=Basic_Science_of_MMS Oxidation as used to kill microorganisms Chlorine dioxide kills most microorganisms through the process of oxidation . Oxidation is not always understood , with many people thinking that oxidation is the process of adding oxygen to other substances . That is not the case . Oxidation is the process by which substances are destroyed . The electrons that hold a substance together are pulled off by the oxidizing chemical and thus the substance then comes apart , which of course , destroys it . Chlorine dioxide is unique in the chemical world because the chlorine dioxide molecule has a chemical characteristic that changes and makes it selective for pathogens . The change happens when the chlorine dioxide molecule pulls one electron from a pathogen , which normally is not enough to damage the pathogen , but that electron then comes over to the chlorine dioxide molecule and changes it . When this happens a thousand times or a hundred thousand times , the pathogen is destroyed , mainly because this process blows a hole in the side of the pathogen . [ 5 ] Just for your information , there is another oxidation process which is called chlorination , which involves the chlorine coming over and combining with the item to be oxidized , thus making new compounds . When this happens with chlorination , many times , one of the new compounds because of the chlorine involved , is carcinogenic ( cancer causing ) . This information is just added for reference . Chlorination has nothing to do with MMS , but it might confuse some of the critics who happen to use Clorox bleach in their laundry . But again , chlorination has nothing to do with MMS . [ 6 ]
