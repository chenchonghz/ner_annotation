Our DAN told us that quinolinic acid in particular is quite excitatory . This is why many find improvements in hyperactive behavior when supplementing niacin -- niacinamide or inositol hexaniacinate are the preferred form for kids as they do n't cause flushing . Dr. Yasko postulates that the niacinamide is used by the body as an antibacterial/antiviral and to increase T cell activity . Therefore it upregulates the degradation of tryptophan into niacinamide when suffering from bacterial and/or viral infections , which puts a drain on the normal conversion of tryptophan to serotonin .
