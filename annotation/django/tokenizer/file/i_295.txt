My tin 5 year old sons with regressive autism still wear size 3T clothing . They now both weigh around 33 lbs. , which is an improvement since they were stuck around 30 lbs . for about two years . Three secretin infusions seem to have helped them gain weight ( but have not helped much with autistic symptoms ) . They also have immune issues . One symptom of hypogammaglobulinemia is slowed growth . Jesse has been scoped by Dr. Krigsman ( including pillcam ) and had lymphonodular hyperplasia in the stomach and small intestine . Inflammation in the small intestine may contribute to slow growth . One of the first things Dr. Krigsman looks at in the volumes of paperwork and lab results you have to do before he 'll see you is the growth chart . He 's mentioned that major changes on the weight chart are often a red flag for problems in the small intestine ( after ruling out hypothyroidism , etc . through lab tests ) . Both of our boys also had big pulls of lead on an IV CaEDTA challenge . One symptom of lead poisoning is delayed growth , particularly bone growth since much of the lead in a human body gets stored in the `` long bones . '' If you have n't done thyroid testing , start there . _________________ Vance Dad of 8 year old autistic twins Jesse and Alexander
