Are you ladies still giving niacin ? ? ? How 's it going ? I was researching KPU more last night , and came across some eye-popping stuff about niacin ! It sounded as if KPU can be treated with niacin alone ( in some cases ) , with excellent results . It makes me a little nervous though , because what I read recommended the type of niacin that causes flushing . It recommended against the flush-free or timed released niacin . My daughter has been doing FABULOUS on a B-complex vitamin that has 150mg Niacin in it , but what I have been reading suggests going up to 1000 mg . I am toying with upping her niacin . Curious if anyone is doing this ? ? ?
