Glutamate can very well be a key marker in the increase however how do we justify the high levels of toxicity in these children if it 's not from the vaccines ? I mean 90 % of children with ASD have one thing in common vaccines . There are very few children on the spectrum that have not been vaccinated ... and most of those children where exposed prenatally by rhogam and flu shots , amalgam fillings , fish ate by the mother and so on . According to stats , 80 % of the children have either very low or very high homocysteine , low gluthiathione levels and have the methylation defiency genes and blocking folate receptors antibodies . this in combination with one vaccination containing trace amounts of mercury and other toxins is potent combo for asd or other issues .
