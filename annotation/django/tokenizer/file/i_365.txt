My 3.75 y/o son has been on DMSA ( 25 mg/4hrs 3 days on , 11 off ) for 8 rounds . We added ALA two weeks ago , so round 2 of DMSA/ALA chelation starts tomorrow . Note we also added TMG ( 3 x daily ) and GABA ( 3 x daily ) just after the first DMSA/ALA round . We have seen a marked increase in word approximations . ( He is essentially non-verbal -- still only says single words like `` mama '' `` dada '' etc.. ) Just this week he started to try to approximate at least one syllable of any word you ask him to say -- that 's a new development since the start of DMSA/ALA ( +TMG GABA ) . Is this consistent with others experience with DMSA/ALA /or TMG /or GABA ? I think it 's the ALA addition . What else can I expect now that ALA is in the chelation mix ?
