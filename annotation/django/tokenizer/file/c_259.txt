According to stats , 80 % of the children have either very low or very high homocysteine , low gluthiathione levels and have the methylation defiency genes and blocking folate receptors antibodies . this in combination with one vaccination containing trace amounts of mercury and other toxins is potent combo for asd or other issues . Do you have a link to stats about very few children on the spectrum that have not been vaccinated ? I personally in real life know of at least 4 kids I can think of off the top of my head that are un-vax 'd and still on the spectrum . And I only personally know maybe 40-50 kids on the spectrum so those odds do n't seem to hold up in my experience . ETA : I should clarify , if the vaccinate rate is only 80 % and 80 % of kids with autism were vaccinated there is no indication that vaccines have an impact on autism . So I 'm asking that taken into account vaccination rates how big is the impact of non-vaxing on autism ? Edited by : Annaquin
