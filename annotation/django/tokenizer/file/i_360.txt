I have been following this thread with huge interest , my son has Pddnos and mithocondrial disorder , and since I am medical doctor curing my son my theory is always if a product or supplement is bringing more regression then positive reaction it should be monitored , and I have done research of regression that curcumin produces is related to mithocondrial damage , ( i usualy do this type of research because i firmaly believe that anyone that cures autism but doesnt take serious mithocondrial issue is making huge mistake ) , and what I have discovered is this curious article that i would prefer to share with you . this is the link of this article : http : //toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/co ... l/91/2/476 [ b ] We are the first to evaluate the damage to nDNA and mtDNA induced by curcumin in the metabolically competent HepG2 cells . Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( QPCR ) and immunocytochemistry staining of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) , we found that curcumin induced damage to both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in a dose-dependent manner and that the damage to mtDNA appeared more extensive than that of nDNA . The alkaline comet assay was used to determine nDNA fragmentation . As the conceivable cause of DNA damage , the level of ROS and lipid peroxidation were analyzed . Our data suggested that low doses of curcumin did not damage DNA , and at the low doses , curcumin could play an antioxidant role in carcinogenesis . But at high doses , curcumin itself imposed oxidative stress and damaged DNA . This study helps support the hypothesis that curcumin may play a conflicting dual role in carcinogenesis according to its doses . We also concluded that the extensive mtDNA damage may be an initial event triggering the observed curcumin-induced cell death . [ /b ]
