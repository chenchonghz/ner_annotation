Willsmom - Do you mind sharing your AC chelation plan ? Do you always use DMSA+ALA or Do you use DMSA only weeks or ALA only weeks ? I know currently JeniB is having such schedule ( JeniB - I sent you a PM ) . I have a feeling that my kid needs as much DMSA as ALA and I 'm planning to alternate DMSA only rounds with DMSA+ALA when i get to a point to add ALA , right now I 'm only on DMSA . All I want to know is does switching or doing DMSA only with DMSA+ALA be beneficial ? Any advice from your experience is appreciated .
