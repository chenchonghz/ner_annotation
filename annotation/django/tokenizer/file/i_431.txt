Make sure there are regular bowel movements . Natural Calm works really well for BMs for us and the magnesium in it is also really calming . Probiotics are really important for helping to normalize pH and for recolonizing with good strains after you remove a player in the ecosystem . I have used a zapper and it did work but I stopped after I read that it can , like Rx treatments , just drive the parasite into harder to reach places like organs , brain , pelvic area . Herbals were very effective for us , and also coconut oil and garlic . The other side of it is making sure you have an environment that is inhospitable to them . We saw big results from alkalizing and getting zinc/copper balanced . Homeopathic treatments were also very helpful . Do you give the charcoal right before bed then ? We were trying Ornithine and baking soda baths . I think charcoal might constipate him further , so I have been hesitate to try it . We have tried many forms of magnesium , our little guy is a complex case for some reason . We are currently off of probiotics for a stool test , so that is a really good point ... maybe it was offsetting the reaction . How did you alkalize ? Lemon juice , acv , diet ? What herbals were most successful ? Ca n't herbals also drive the parasite into harder to reach places , if prescriptions and the zapper do ? I was really hoping the zapper might be a good option ./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif
