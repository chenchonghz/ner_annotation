Resent research shows that autistic children have significantly higher plasma glutamate levels than non-autistic children . http : //www.plos & # 111 ; ne.org/article/info % 3Adoi % 2F10.1371 % 2Fjournal.p & # 111 ; ne.0025340 http : //www.plosone.org/article/info % 3Adoi % 2F10.1371 % 2Fjourna http : //www.plosone.org/article/info % ... .1371 % 2Fjourna l.pone.0025340 Glutamate is a vital neurotransmitter at normal levels ; however , it has the potential to act as an excitotoxin at elevated levels . The above research sheds some light on why the low-free glutamate diet detailed on http : //www.autismrecoveryprogram.com/ www.autismrecoveryprogram.com is successful with autistic children . Apparently , autistic children have a more difficult time clearing glutamate than normal children , allowing it to reach excitotoxic levels , and carefully limiting dietary free glutamate addresses this deficit .
