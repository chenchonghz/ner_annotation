We just ran a comprehensive metabolic screen to check liver function for our dd after some time on both flagyl ( for clostridia ) and fluconazole for yeast . Here are the results : Glucose 86 ( ref 57-117 ) BUN 5 ( ref 5-17 ) Creatinine *L* .17 ( ref .5-1.2 ) Sodium 142 ( ref 132-145 ) Potassium 4.0 ( ref 3/6-4.6 ) Chloride 105 ( ref 96-111 ) CO2 25 ( ref 21-32 ) Anion Gap 12 ( ref 5-15 ) Calcium *H* 10.2 ( ref 8.5-10.1 ) Total Bilirubin .2 ( ref .2-1 ) Total Protein 7 ( ref 6.4-8.2 ) Albumin *H* 3.8 ( ref 2.6-3.6 ) Alk Phos 192 ( ref 104-345 ) AST 37 ( ref 5 -37 ) ALT 33 ( ref 7-65 ) Her creatinine is very low . Does anyone know what might cause this ? She does not eat a lot of protein at all . I 've read in passing that ammonia levels related to bacteria can cause low creatinine . But , when I do a search , it also comes up with some very serious disorders that can cause this . I have read that different labs use different ranges and have seen a range of .3 for the low end for children rather than .5 . Either way , it is seriously out of range . thanks for any insight !
