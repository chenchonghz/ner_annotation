I am looking into using this product . Just curious if anybody had any experience with it ? Thanks ! Elle Kids Chelat Heavy Metal Chelator is the same formula as Bio-Chelat heavy metal chelator , only with added trace minerals . It is manufactured by Dr. Thomas Nissen , who introduced Bio-Chelat to North America from Germany . Kids Chelat has some very special and unique properties that set it apart from other chelators on the market . Kids Chelat is a patented chelator that is composed of a very dilute solution of Disodium EDTA ( 200 mg per 110 ml bottle ) , mineral salts , and a small amount of an oxidative catalyser . Because of the addition of the oxidative catalyser , which loosens the molecular bonds of the heavy metal ions attached to the proteins ' sufhydral group , only a tiny amount of EDTA needs to be used for maximum effectiveness . Thus , there are no harmful side effects with Kids Chelat . It does not affect or harm the liver , kidneys or gastro-intestinal tract . Clinical studies in Germany have proven its safety and effectiveness for children . Comes in a 110 ml bottle . 1 bottle is a 2 - 6 month supply for children . Recommended timespan for detoxifying with Kids Chelat is 3 - 12 months .
