Spect scan confirmed seizures , but they only manifest as high stim movements , our antiseizure meds : Prednisolone = increase in eye contact , no other gains Lamictal = increase in night wakening and constipation , no gains Neurontin - no improv - no side effects Neurontin + Trilaptal = drammatic increase in stim , no gains , actually got worse Depakote = drammatic increase in stim , no gains Now in Clonazepam , we just see terrible mood swings , no gains HBOT made her stim super high . After having done the spect scan the neurologist told us that our kid should have never done HBOT because her brain is very hot already with signs of seizure activities . It explained why she responded so badly to HBOT ... .. I wish I would have known before.. Pretty depressing ... . sorry our DAN recommended adding Keppra to Clonazepam later this month and adding Prednisolone again . We are trying all different combinations , and it already took us 1 year just on seizure meds . Let 's see , for the moment I am loosing trust that the antiseizure meds can actually help ... .
