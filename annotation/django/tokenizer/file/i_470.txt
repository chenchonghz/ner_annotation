Oxygen has the next highest oxidation potentials of 1.28 volts . Those oxidation potentials of .95 and 1.28 volts can do very little damage to the human body . This is because these voltages can not overcome the opposing oxidation potentials in the human cells and tissues . And as you can see , if oxygen does very little or no damage , then the lesser oxidation voltage of chlorine dioxide is not likely to do any damage at all . [ 9 ] Chlorine Dioxide is highly selective and does not harm stomach and intestine useful microorganisms : Chlorine dioxide is highly selective for pathogens that cause diseases in the body , and does not kill the various useful flora of the stomach and intestines . This is due to the unique properties of the chlorine dioxide molecule . Once again , I really have no idea where mms supporters get this stuff . This is a very toxic substance . It 's a great external disinfectant . Just a very quick google search can tell somebody everything they ever wanted to know about this substance and why it does not belong in the body . Highly selective ? Honestly , do a little research of your own before believing everything Ms. Rivera and the dude in the plastic bag write down . However , I am sure they 're making a pretty penny off of this miracle bleach .
