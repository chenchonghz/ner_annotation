Sorry I took so long on this reply ... The only supplement that 's really necessary on the LOD is the calcium citrate without vitamin D. The citrate is what you need , not the other forms . You take a bit at each meal or snack , as the calcium binds with the oxalates in food and ushers it out of the system via the stool or urine . The N-acetyl glutamine ( NAG ) is also recommended as it helps strengthen the bonds between cells in the gut lining , helping a leaky gut to heal . All the other supplements are kind of on an as-needed basis . BUT , you will want to be careful of taking vitamin C while you do the diet , as it converts to oxalate . Perhaps the RDI or something close would still be ok . If you post your e-mail address , I can give you a copy of my `` working food list '' that hangs in my kitchen . We are low oxalate , low salicylate and yeast free right now , and use almost no pre-made products . We still eat Van 's Waffles , t hough they have some soy , but I 'm trying to replace them with a GOOD waffle recipe , and ca n't find one right now . _________________ Amanda , mom of 3
