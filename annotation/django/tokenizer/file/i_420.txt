im on round 76 and its been 2 years since i started with a/c protocol yes my kid is nearly recovered , i seriously doubt any of you experts can tell my kid ever had a problem if you listen to a/c he will tell you from his experience that well over 75 % of kids can recover with his protocol im not sure of the statistics but my kid has no asd symptoms any more just started kndergarten has friends is friendly reads very well above grade level , is spontaneous , does math , music , sports is outgoing has good language what else ... thanks to andy for establishing this life saving protocol hair test results suggested my kid was toxic and a/c protocol cleaned her up and please believe me that before i started the protocol i was worried sick that my kid would never be able to care for her self and would always be in special ed -- now im worried to make nsure that my kid gets enough challenging work to do at nt school cause she is ahead of the other kids
