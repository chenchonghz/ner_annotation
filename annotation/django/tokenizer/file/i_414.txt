Amanda , Our 3 year old son recently started on the low oxalate diet due to a sky high oxalic acid level on his last OAT test . We also are giving calcium citrate 1 capsule 2x/day and VSL3 1/2 capsule 2x/day . You mentioned in your post about having issues with VSL3 with your young kids . What kind of issues were you seeing with the VSL3 ? I think we are going through the dumping stage now . The first 3 or so days Ian was great ( getting great reports from ABA , happy , etc ) . We started VSL3 about 3 days later ( 10 days ago ) and his behavior has been irratic ( good some days and bad others , sleep issues , gassy , etc ) . Could this be from the VSL3 ? From what i read it sounds like dumping but was curious your experience . We have seen some improvement with sleep issues and crankiness in the last day or so but still very moody . The only three veggies Ian eats are peas , sweet potato and squash . For Sweet Pot and Squash were were using an organic puree . We eliminated the sweet pot and squash because of high oxalate level . The squash was butternut squash , does anyone know if that type of squash is okay ( i read on a previous post that summer squash is okay ) . The only veggie we have left is peas . I ordered the low oxalate cookbook but am still waiting for it to arrive . Thanks Sheri
