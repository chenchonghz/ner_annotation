Thanks . Right now he is on pro-bio gold and primal defense twice a day . I will order the sac . B and Culturelle and start those asap . I have the flagyl ( although it 's only for 14 days ) that I will start next week . I will do the culturelle during the flagyl treatment , then start Sac . B and continue the Culturelle after it is over ? Does that sound right ? What did you mean that you learned to rotate anibacterials/antifungals ? I know you said that you have to give the flagyl every few months , but I was a little confused about that . Thanks so much again ! _________________ `` My hands are full , my heart is not ''
