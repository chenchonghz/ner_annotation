HiJeniferB , I have a bottle of regular B1 , does it work too ? the bottle says 100mg per cap , how much shall give to a 4.1yo , 35lbs kid ? And how much B6 ( regular form OK ) to support B1 function ? will too much of B1 cause other bs to be deficient ? will thiamine cause hyperactivity in some kids ? I gave 100mgX3 yesterday , and she was hyperactive . could be coincidence though , as we are doing antivirals and chelation togeter . Just want to know if B1 has some hyperactive effect . thank you JeniB
