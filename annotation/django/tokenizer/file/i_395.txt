Hi , We have had high ammonia since 2007 and we just did some labs and his ammonia is high and his platelets are high . I thought his high ammonia was from doing A/C protocol with DMSA/ALA however in 2007 we did not do DMSA/ALA . His liver tests are fine . Anyone go through this and figure out why this is happening ? I might have to stop the DMSA/ALA my son is regressing . He is not the same as he was before . Maybe its true about the CBS mutation with YAsko . He is stimming and humming I am sure he has yeast and clostridia and other bacteria . I see no improvement on DMSA/ALA . We see a doctor this Saturday and he does EDTA IV 's . I do like the A/C protocol about half life . I do n't like the fact that if can take yrs before you see progress . I can not imagine my son being like this for several yrs . Its so bad he can not even learn a darn thing . Non stop humming with his ears plugged . I feel like I went 5 steps backwards . I hope this doctor can help us . He also has a HBOT and a sauna . I never done the sauna for chelation . I might have to stop everything and start over because its just a big mess here . Oh and we did some genetic testing that was not done when he was 3 yrs old . Well message said he has a abnormal DNA mutation . SO here I am thinking my son is doomed . SO is this genetic mutation telling me why bother with biomedical nothing will change . How can I fix a DNA mutation ? SOrry I am so crushed here . Tell me there is hope . SOrry I am so down , but I have yet to here back from the genetic counselor and I am just sitting here thinking the worse . Kathy PS I wish I could write some positive responses . Everytime I write a post its so negative . Trust me I really want to be positive . Hopefully we can fix some of this and he will get back to at least where he was before . That would be great for me .
