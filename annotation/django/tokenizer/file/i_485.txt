Dear Kulkulan and HappyMom , Thank you both for responding . Both of your posts pointed to the corollary question I have about MB12 . I was encouraged by his doctor to start giving him methy folate 1 mg . But it put me in a bit of a dilemma . ( For a bit of background , he does not have the MTHF mutation . Instead , he has a mutation that makes his retain iron : hemochromatosis . He is heterogeneous . ) I have been giving him Kirkman 's B complex daily , that has the unconverted folic acid . Would I be able to continue to give a B complex with methy folate at 1 mg ? I as told to essentially take out the B-complex and just use the methy folate . I have been giving DMG , also , in the hopes of starting his speech . What are your thoughts ? NAC is a supplement that I 've wanted to try , but just hesitated because of the contra-indictation according to the AC Chelation protocol . My son 's homocystine was within the 'normal range ' , but just barely . So , he 's definitely on the low side . If I were to add NAC , would I give it on the same day as the shot , every day ? What dosages do you recommend ? Raising his glutathione levels is something that I 'm critically concerned about , I just dont ' know the best way to do it . Thank you for your help and support .
