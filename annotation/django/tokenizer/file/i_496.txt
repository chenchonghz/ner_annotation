What is an infusion like ? My son had his first infusion on Thursday in Santa Ana , California . The infusion is an all-day event . He was given saline , then a small amount of dextrose , and then the `` product '' followed by dextrose and saline again . We gave him Motrin and Benedryl for 48 hours . My son was tired . It was not a disaster . My son 's immune system is a mess . He has mulluscums all over his skin . We think he may have PANDAS and/or Lyme disease . My son is a non-responder to most of the regular DAN stuff . OVer the past year , my son has grown Paul and more and more miserable with pressing his lower GI system . Anyone have any secret AETNA codes to help get this covered ? We are hoping that IVIG helps him . Thanks , Hollie
