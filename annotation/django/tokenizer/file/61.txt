Hello Everyone, My DS 1st IEP is tommorrow. He was accepted to a great school and will attend from 8-2pm.  My only prepared demand is for him to have a weighted vest for the 1st 2 hrs of the day and 1hr after nap. I also want to suggest arguementive technology. (Early Intervention gave him ST 2x wk 30mins, OT 2x wk 45mins, ABA 3x wk 1hr) Any suggestions? Im just wondering how its going to be? Should I be prepared for a battle?  - AS DS 4 yrs old  "There's room in the garden"  A tulip doesn't strive to impress anyone.  It doesn't have to.  It is different.
