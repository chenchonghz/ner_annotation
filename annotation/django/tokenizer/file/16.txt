It is all natural , none of the chemicals that are in the other ones . We started this in August and have seen no side effects at all . He is understanding things a little better since then . However , we also started vitamin therapy at the same time so I ca n't tell you if it was the chelation , the vitamins , or a combination of the two that has made the difference . Ruth Hi Ruth , Are you doing the chelation by yourself or with a DAN practitioner ? I was wondering if we can do the safe version of chelation ourselves . Danyasdad
