They CAN cause die off yes , but not always for everybody . It depends on what type of enzyme you use . From enzymestuff.com : http : //www.enzymestuff.com/conditionbacteria.htm Research Enzymes and Yeast Enzymes for Fighting Yeast There are a few enzyme products on the market that are formulated for fighting yeast ( Candida ) problems . You want to particularly check the label and look for these types of enzymes : proteases ( target proteins ) cellulases ( target fiber ) hemicellulases ( target fiber ) xylanases ( target fiber ) Yeast cells have tough outer shells made up of protein and cellulose . The shells may be several layers think and present a barrier to the commonly used anti-fungal medications and over-the-counter supplements . The strategy of using the yeast fighting enzymes is to decompose or break down the yeast coverings so the yeast dies . Many people dealing with yeast have found that combining an anti-fungal with a yeast enzyme product gives a powerful synergistic effect on yeast . The enzymes breakdown the coating and the anti-fungals can act more quickly and effectively in destroying yeast cells . In addition , protease enzymes can help reduce die-off discomfort because they can further breakdown the waste and residue by the dead yeast cells . You can try giving more proteases if die-off is too uncomfortable , or simply reduce the amount of enzymes and anti-fungals given ( go lower-n-slower ) . see The Great Low-n-Slow Method with Additional Guidelines for Yeast Control . Because most digestive enzymes used in conjunction with a gluten free casein free diet contain very large amounts of proteases it is possible that die off could be seen
