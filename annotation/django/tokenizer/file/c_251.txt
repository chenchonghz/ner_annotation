When my son was about 5-6 they were trying to find a dosage of Ritalin that worked for him and the doctor upped it too much and he would lay on the floor and just sweat with his little heart beating so fast I thought he was going to have a heart attack or something . He is now 14 and about 115 pounds and they have him on 54mg of time released concerta , 10mg of abilify and 50mg of trazadone at bedtime . He was on risperdal for the longest time and the doctor decided to switch him to abilify stating that usually if it works for a child it works really well . I do n't see any changes for the better , if anything his aggression is worse . I am waiting to hear from his doctor at this moment requesting he be put back on the risperdal . He has become quite aggressive lately and it seems school is pushing to have me institutionalize my son . I will never let happen he is all I know he is my routine , he is my son and my only child , my purpose in life . If anyone has any advice on meds that have worked for their child in their teens for aggression please help I do n't want them to take him away.- Tina mom of 14yr old non verbal , severely autistic son CJ
