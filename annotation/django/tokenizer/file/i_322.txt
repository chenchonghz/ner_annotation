Is it okay to give my son a calcium citrate supplement that does NOT contain magnesium ? I do supplement magnesium separately , but will do so away from the calcium . I have heard that calcium carbonate can constipate and that calcium citrate is absorbed better anyway . I 'm looking for something gfcfsf that is chewable . Does this Carlson calcium citrate look okay ? Or , any other recommendations/comments ? http : //www.carlsonlabs.com/product_deta ... 4cfcbee4ad Thanks so much , Daphne
