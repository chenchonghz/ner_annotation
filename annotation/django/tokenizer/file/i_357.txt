Hello , Yes , the list of treatments is kind of short , I call it biomed-lite . Also , those are the ones I have stuck with , we did try a couple of other things but for no more than a month each , we droped them for one reason or another . MB12 I really wish we had stuck with but somehow we never have gone back to it . He does still need a little help with the attention span so I was thinking of trying the Grape Seed Extract people were posting about . I attribute Nelson 's progress to secretin and enzymes and him . Secretin is what got him talking but enzymes are what cleared up a lot of other issues he had . Before enzymes he had bouts of nausea and diareahh so bad I would be calling the doctors and thinking of hospitals and he was only 2-3 years old . And the exzema was so bad his skin looked raw . When we tried the diet he started to get better but the enzymes took it all away . In Nelson 's case it was very obvious they were working . So I tend to think as the secretin kick started him but the enzymes kept him running . These days we do not even do secretin anymore it is just enzymes and vitamins . He has even gone without vitamins sometimes but I am afraid to stop the enzymes . More than anything , Nelson is a fighter and he will push himself harder than I ever have . I am happy with his grades but he wants to be in honors classes , he has a couple of friends but he wants more . His sister is also great at helping him , showing him how to do things , keeping an eye on him when they were in the same school . Her friends used to report to her if they thought he was upset in anyway . He is now taller than her but he will always be her `` little brother '' . Nelson was officially DX at 2 3/4 but we had suspicions since he was about 6 months old . The pediatrician would not believe me and all she offered when he was DX was the old `` ABA is the only way '' line . It was n't until we saw a DAN doctor that we began to have help . However , after seeing his improvements she actually asked if there was any documentation she could read up on the DAN approach . Hope this helped , _________________ Vanessa mom to Isabel ( gifted ) Nelson ( PDDNOS - HFA )
