My son is on round 33 AC chelation.. my DH and I have decided to have our amalgams out and we have also started chelating . My DH is on round 13 I am currently on round 3 of AC Chelation.. We also get headaches . I asked some other adults who also follow the ac protocol and they describe the same thing . Its a very mild headache that seems to disapear by the second day on round . I only started on 12.5mg dmsa my DH also started on 12.5mg dmsa and only experienced the headaches since increasing his dose to 25mg ... .maybe you should decrease your daughters dose , And increase it very slowly .
