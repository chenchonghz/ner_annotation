Can DMAE and/or B5 cause increased scripting ? My son has always scripted , but it increased big time after Christmas break . The only thing that I changed during break was adding DMAE ( 100 mg ) with B5 ( 100 mg ) . His DAN suggested halfing his mB12 , cutting it from 0.06 to 0.03 every 3 days and hopefully it wo n't negatively affect his ability to communicate . But I am wondering about the DMAE . Any thoughts ? _________________ After the storm comes the rainbow .
