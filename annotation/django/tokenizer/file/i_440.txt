Thanks for the info JenB ! That 's a lot of Riboflavin ! Our B-complex - made for adults - has only 15mg , and I split the capsule into a few doses , so he 's not getting nearly the 90mg you 're recommending . I have n't found a Riboflavin without any additives . I 'll keep looking . My son is very sensitive to additives and fillers . Many of them are from coconut or palm which he is sensitive to . He is also VERY sensitive to any thing from this list of names for hidden MSG : http : //www.truthinlabeling.org/hiddensources.html These are often in supplements , and I 've been working for months to find supplements I think will be safe for him . Even the glutamate blockers - ie pycogenol - have these ingredients . I am extra concerned today because I read last night how NMDA receptors can be affected during glutaric acidemia - the NMDA receptors are involved with glutamate and I think that glutamate is one of my son 's main problems . http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1134/ found this citation from a post by CaringDad a while back . It 's so hard to put this all together ! ! Thanks again for any help ! ! -Rachel
