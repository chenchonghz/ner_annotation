My son had his second Secretin IV ( one month apart ) on Saturday . During the prior week , we had seen some significant improvements ( we have made several changes in the past two months , and we were hopeful that something was starting to click ) . Starting Sunday , however , we have been going through probably our worst period since his diagnosis . Daniel is extremely resistant , can not take no for an answer for even a few seconds , has been having tantrums like we have never seen before , and has been extraordinarily emotional , at times crying hysterically for no apparent reason and appearing remarkably sad . The IV Secretin is the only change in the past few weeks ( he had no reaction -- good or bad -- after the first Secretin IV a month ago ) , so we think it must be that . Has anyone seen negatives like these ? Thanks , Robert
