Yes , you must use choline . Why ? Because manganese deficiency occurs because of what is referred to as a metabolic deficiency . This means one occurs because of another . Without choline , the body can not store manganese in the liver . But conversely , it takes manganese to activate choline . They each need each other to perform well . So the reason your child is manganese deficient is because there also exists a choline deficiency . The liver biopsies showed the dogs manganese levels were at only 1/4th or less of what they should be . So when you start to supplement choline - it very quickly depletes those small stores because now the liver starts to function normally in using iron , copper and manganese . If you only supplement manganese - it will obviously help with the manganese deficiency symptoms you have been seeing in your children , but the body will be unable to re stock it 's liver stores ( 10 mg. ) . Also , when you replace the manganese - it activates the very small amount of choline that is in the body . That helps wonderfully with brain function . But you will very quickly use up that choline - so it has to be replaced . Knowing the ratios to replace them depends allot on the hair charts and what people tell me as symptoms each day when starting the program . I make recommendations as to which to increase or decrease as you go along . Please either private message me your daughters actual hair chart values for each mineral and metal or list them on the web site . I will then review the chart . Remember - you never evaluate individual minerals or metals on hair charts - they must be viewed all together to understand how the organ systems are functioning and to what extent the stress level is . Thank you so much ! I will send you the values after I bath them and they 're in bed . About an hour from now . Thanks ! _________________ http : //thecultofrecovery.wordpress.com/
