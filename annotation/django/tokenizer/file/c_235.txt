My Ds has been on Resperdal for 4 months now . At first , it was like magic ! He slept and he signed and he did not tantrum . We go back next month to see our Psych and I think I will just take him off . I see nothing , nil , zilch that it is doing , except making him gain weight . Oh yeah , he takes 1 mg at night and .5 in AM . we started off with .5 at night then upped to .5 also in AM and then added an extra at night . I am very disappointed , becaus eit was so incredible for the first month or so . THe Ped Neuro told me that it is always a game of adjusting and seeing what will and what will not work . My DS has gained 7 or 8 pounds ( 53 pounds ) and he just turned 4 , but we are BIG ( lol ) folks to start . At first my DS really was eating and trying different foods , but that went away too ... sigh ... ... ..- Jean
