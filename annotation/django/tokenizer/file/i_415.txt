You both have it wrong . People with autism have a deficiency of niacin and B vitamins due to inherent intestinal problems . They are usually lethargic for that very reason and the body needs niacin for proper brain function and physical energy . I gave my son with autism niacin along with improving his intestinal mucosa lining and within a couple of weeks it 's as if he 's never had the illness .
