Dear Jen : Well , selenium is difficult to use because , like so many other essential things , it has to be at just the right amount . Too little causes problems and too much causes problems . The problem is that too much can cause irreversible problems . Fish oil and Cod Liver oil have selenium , and I read that people do n't get toxic amounts of selenium from them , thus that is why so many people use them . I have gotten great results for my whole family from fish oil and cod liver oil . Its best to use them long-term , like for a year . We have been using cod liver oil mostly now for about nine months , and I really can say I believe it has helped tremendously . I use other treatments as well , and I can say , that after a year of treatments , my severe Asperger 's son is probably completely symptom-free and my other children , who have been on treatments for a lesser period , also have significant improvements . They have gone from special needs schooling to regular schooling . Thus , I recommend using just the selenium that comes with your choice of multivitamin along with cod liver oil - for your selenium needs . _________________ Heidi N
