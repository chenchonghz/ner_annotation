I hope Teresa and CK2 do n't mind I did this ... . just trying to help !

This synthesis is thought to trigger enzymes that mediate stem/progenitor cell release . '' By University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , According to a study to be published in the American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulation Physiology , a typical course of hyperbaric oxygen treatments increases by eight-fold the number of stem cells circulating in a patient 's body . Stem cells , also called progenitor cells are crucial to injury repair . The study currently appears on- line and is scheduled for publication in the April 2006 edition of the American Journal . Stem cells exist in the bone marrow of human beings and animals and are capable of changing their nature to become part of many different organs and tissues . In response to injury , these cells move from the bone marrow to the injured sites , where they differentiate into cells that assist in the healing process . The movement , or mobilization , of stem cells can be triggered by a variety of stimuli including pharmaceutical agents and hyperbaric oxygen treatments . Where as drugs are associated with a host of side effects , hyperbaric oxygen treatments carry a significantly lower risk of such effects . `` This is the safest way clinically to increase stem cell circulation , far safer than any of the pharmaceutical options , '' said Stephen Thom , MD , Ph.D. , Professor of Emergency Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and lead author of the study . `` This study provides information on the fundamental mechanisms for hyperbaric oxygen and offers a new theoretical therapeutic option for mobilizing stem cells . '' `` We reproduced the observations from humans in animals in order to identify the mechanism for the hyperbaric oxygen effect , '' added Thom . `` We found that hyperbaric oxygen mobilizes stem/progenitor cells because it increases synthesis of a molecule called nitric oxide in the bone marrow . This synthesis is thought to trigger enzymes that mediate stem/progenitor cell release . '' Hopefully , future study of hyperbaric oxygen 's role in mobilizing stem cells will provide a wide array of treatments for combating injury and disease .
