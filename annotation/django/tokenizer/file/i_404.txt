Yes , definitely have his thyroid levels rechecked . The chelation may be releasing metals affecting the thyroid gland , displacing iodine . From http : //www.alkalizeforhealth.net/Liodine2.htm : Dr. Brownstein indicates that iodine is also a chelator of mercury and had tested quite carefully the amounts removed . [ xxiii ] Mercury not only poisons the nervous system and digestive tract , it can also poison the thyroid gland . There are 4 iodine binding sites or receptors on the thyroid gland . These receptors bind with the iodine we get from our diet . The iodine enters the thyroid and activates it . If the thyroid is not absorbing enough iodine it will not be fully activated and the body 's temperature will be abnormally low . Mercury from dental fillings can migrate to the thyroid gland and sit on one or more of the thyroid 's 4 iodine receptors blocking the iodine from reaching the receptors and activating the thyroid . When this happens iodine is not absorbed in normal amounts by the thyroid gland . The result is low body temperature or hypothyroidism . Goodluck ! !
