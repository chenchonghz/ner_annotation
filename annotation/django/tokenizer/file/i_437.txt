WD , The Awaken Nutrition website is being updated this week and , yes , there are typos . I agree that the picolinate forms of some minerals are also excellent . The updated website will contain more information about each nutrient . Just click on the vitamin or mineral on the supplement fact page . There will be information about food sources of these nutrients as well as the benefits of each . Likewise , the website explains why iron , copper , calcium , and manganese were intentionally omitted from the Agape formula . To briefly explain , a large percentage of my patients with autism have high copper and manganese levels at baseline . You probably know that improving a child 's copper/zinc ratio is beneficial . Likewise , a high manganese level can lead to toxicity and interfere with the absorption of more important minerals such as zinc . Calcium stimulates the NMDA receptor , which increases glutamate activity . This is not desirable in anyone , but should especially be avoided in the presence of most individuals with self-stimulatory behaviors , anxiety , tics , seizures , or other signs of excess glutamate activity . Calcium is also very toxic to mitochondria and the optimization of mitochondrial function is a high priority in anyone with ADD or autism . I have published on this topic and another paper about the adverse effects of calcium on mitochondria came out earlier this year . We have been brainwashed by the Dairy Council to think that we all need to drink milk , but I strongly disagree . There are other healthy dietary sources of calcium and vitamin D levels are the more important variable in preventing osteoporosis . Most physicians will gladly order a vitamin D level if you request it . I hope this answers your questions . Cindy Schneider , MD
