If no gains were made other than getting the metals out of his body then that is enough for me. My son doesn't have to turn backflips from a chelating bath to show it helps. We plan to continue them and test the metals in the water when the bath is finished.  Most parents use the clay baths to chelate as a "mild chelator" b/c they are going low and slow. There are test that have been done on clay baths showing the toxic levels of metals coming out. It's somewhere on their site I believe.  I do not not expect to see many gains from these baths. Like I said our sole purpose is to pull the metals. Even if it's just a small amount. I have given him his bath after his DMPS and the tub fills with balck specs when he is finished. - SashasMom  www.sashasrecovery.com
