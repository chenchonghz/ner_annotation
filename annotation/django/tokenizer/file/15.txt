LiverLife is great and all kids should be on that ( or something else ) for liver support . The NDFPlus and NDF are herbal chelators and work well , too , but our DAN doctor said our girls mercury levels are too high-she needs a scrip chelator . We , too , have been using DMSA suppositories for about 6 months with no bad side effects , as long we as keep the gut in check ! - Blessed Mama 23~ADD , SID , anxiety 18~ADD GI issues 17~ADD dyslexia PANDAS 7~ASD - ~My comfort in my suffering is this : Your promise preserves my life ! ~ ~Psalm 119:50~
