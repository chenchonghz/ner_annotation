Per Dr. Bock 's book , I 'm giving my daughter vitamin b 6 with her calcium and magnesium in the morning ( with food ) . I guess I have to give her all of the b vitamins ( not just b 6 ) . Is this a good b complex ? http : //www.iherb.com/Now-Foods-Ultra-B- ... /6281 ? at=0 I ask because 1 ) it has b 12 as as Cyanocobalamin AND Methylcobalamin ( Co-enzyme Form ) and Dibencozide ( Co-enzyme Form ) . I read somewhere that cyanocobalamin is cyanide which is n't good for the body . Methylcobalamin is the prefered b 12 . Most complexes have only Cyano , this one has a combination of cyano and methyl and Divencozide ( whatever that is ) . I could n't find one that only has methylcobalamin and 2 ) I think I read that b 12 is n't absorbed unless it 's given via injection or mist , anyway , so what 's the best way to make sure she gets all her Bs ? P.S . Dr. Neubrander 's site just does n't come up on my computer .
