Tommy had another visit with Dr. Neubrander on September 13 . We started the appointment off informing Dr. N. that Tommy is really stirring up the school staff . Dr. Neubrander alarming replied , You were just here several weeks ago and , as I remember , things Tommy was doing extremely well ! We then gave him Tommys daily communication log from his preschool teacher to read . The school wrote as follows : September 10 : Another great day for Tommy We are all amazed by his language abilities . He is conversing with us all day long ! You guys obviously worked hard this summer . September 12 : Tommy had another amazing week ! So much imaginative play using full sentences and complex language . He is also more affectionate and playful , which is so wonderful to see ! Tommy , at 3 , is fully recovered after completing approximately 300 hours of mHBOT , 3 rounds of oral DMSA , daily MB12 injections , GSH IV , GFCF and organic diet . We took off from mHBOT for the summer . We stopped oral DMSA and GSH IV at the end of July . Without the addition of any other biomedical intervention , other than the daily MB12 injections and the diet , Tommy continued to thrive at an astounding pace . Dr. Neubrander used the analogy of pushing a boulder to the top of the mountain . For the past 1 we have been pushing the boulder to the top of the mountain and it has finally reached the peak ! He still wants us to continue with the mHBOT ( we own it ) on a less stringent schedule , go back to the every 3 day MB12 protocol , stop the GSH IV , stop the oral DMSA , and do a pre and post metals test in 4-6 months . Rick will be putting a recovered video of Tommy on their website by the end of the week .
