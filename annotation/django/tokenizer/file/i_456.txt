I am new to the forum , and I wondered if Seriphos is safe for children . My son just turned 5 and weighs 48lbs . Last month I added A few sprinkles of Thorne Adrenal cortex and selenium in the mornings , and amazingly my son stopped waking up at 2 am every night ! ! if I skip a day , he reminds me at 2am by his pounding on the door ./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif I 've been reading about Phosphatidyl Serine also helps the root of the problem with cortisol , but my son can not have soy , so I read about Seriphos . I also read that it would be even more effective with choline . 1 . Are these safe for children ( Seriphos and Choline ) . 2 . If they are safe , what dosage and time of day should he take them ( both Seriphos dosage and choline dosage fo 48 lbs ) . 3 . On amazon in Seriphos product information , it lists Restrictions : Should not be given simultaneously with adrenergic agonists or alkaloid stimulants . What does that mean ? Does that mean to stop adrenal cortex extract when taking Seriphos ? Thank you for your help . If you have tried it please let me know good or bad how it worked out . I am trying to reduce my son 's anxiety for when he starts kindergarten this fall . Also , while I 'm posting , I want to start inositol to see if it will help with his OCD behaviors . What dose , time of day , and is it supposed to be taken with biotin or some other supplement ? Thanks in advance for all of your help , Monica
