... anyone tried garlic juice ? ? ? ... . Effects of heating , storage , and ultraviolet exposure on antimicrobial activity of garlic juice.Al-Waili NS , Saloom KY , Akmal M , Al-Waili TN , Al-Waili AN , Al-Waili H , Ali A , Al-Sahlani K. Al-Waili 's Charitable Foundation for Science and Trading , New York , New York , USA . noori786 @ yahoo.com This study was designed to investigate the effect of heating , storage , and ultraviolet exposure on antimicrobial activity of garlic juice and its bacteriocidal activity against common human pathogens . Antimicrobial activity of fresh garlic juice was tested against Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus hemolyticus B , S. hemolyticus A , Klebsiella sp. , Shigella dysenteriae , and Candida albicans using the disc method . The dilution method was performed by addition of garlic juice to broth media to obtain 1-100 % concentrations as vol/vol or wt/vol . Garlic juice was used after 24 hours of storage at 4 degrees C , heating to 100 degrees C for 5 minutes , 10 minutes , 30 minutes , and 60 minutes , heating to 80 degrees C for 60 minutes , and 4 hours of exposure to ultraviolet light . Re-culture of specimens taken from garlic-induced negative media was performed in fresh broth free of garlic juice . Results showed that all the isolates were sensitive to fresh garlic juice ; the most sensitive was C. albicans , and the least sensitive was S. hemolyticus A . Heating to 100 degrees C for 30 and 60 minutes completely abolished the antimicrobial activity , while heating for 5 and 10 minutes , storage for 24 hours , and 4 hours of ultraviolet exposure decreased it . Garlic juice was bactericidal at concentrations of 5 % and more . Thus garlic juice has marked antimicrobial activity that makes it a potential agent to be tested in clinical trials . The antimicrobial activity was compromised by storage and heating ; therefore it is advisable to use fresh garlic and avoid boiling it for more than 5 minutes during cooking .
