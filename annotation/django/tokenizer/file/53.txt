Any drug can effect individuals differently (as can over-the-counter preparations, supplements, etc).        IAWTC. Always good advice. Adderall can also affect people who don't actually need it postively, making them think erroneously that they actually do need it. As for the opposite effect, I actually meant caffeine can put people to sleep, not adderall. That's one of the first "soft signs" of ADD. For me, caffeine does center me and calm me mentally, but I do feel physically jittery. I can sleep fine after multiple diet cokes, though.  OK Heffalump did I completely misunderstand the "reverse effect" part of your post? I'm tired. *goes off to take some adderall*Edited by MCA2 on August 01 2006 at 3:24pm
