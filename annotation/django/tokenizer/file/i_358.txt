Yes , we are chelating with DMSA suppositories . Chloe does have inflammation . Her neopterine numbers were high when we had them tested . I was giving the curcumin from the health food store for inflammation before we started the enhansa . Chloe was a child who never got sick until about 7 months ago when she started having chronic ear infections . She had never had an antibiotic before then . I think it is the mold that has been causing them . I think you are right about the kids never healing completely until they detox the things making them sick like metals . I believe a lot of times the kids immune system have switched from TH1 to TH2 immunity which is more of an inflammation reaction . if the immune system is in overdrive they would have constant inflammation . I do think that is one of the things the enhansa is doing for Chloe . I ca n't wait to go back mHbot to see how it does with the enhansa since it works on inflammation too .
