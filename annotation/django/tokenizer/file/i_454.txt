Ok I just read this : What amount of B6 is considered high ? A : From the site http : //www.methylmagic.com/faq.html Some supplements have lots of B6 ( e.g . 100mg ) and the author usually aims for between 20 and 50mg per day of B6 . Excess niacin ( B3 ) is metabolized by methylation and thus uses up methyl groups . Also aim for 50 mg or less . These values are likely for an adult so a child needs much less . According to Pfeiffer , Actually excess niacin ( B3 ) is metabolized by methylation and thus uses up methyl groups . So if you are an over-methylator , meaning you have extra , then B3 is good because it uses them up , but if you are an under-methylator , meaning deficient , then giving extra B3 is bad because it drains an already poor supply . http : //www.enzymestuff.com/methylation.htm SO I think if we are an overmethylator we should improve on niacin and can then still give some methyl groups ( since I agree they are needed ) like methyl folate and B6 ( I think we are HPU too ) . Is B6 considered a methylator or a precursor . I swear all you parents that have been on this forum for a long time need to go to medical school and be able to actually help people if you can get through most of the ( expletive removed ) they probably push on you in medical school by the drug companies like vaccines .
