Our list of antioxidants : Vit C ( only while chelating -- she does n't seem to have a problem with it while on ALA but it gives her the runs without ALA ) Vit E OLE Grape Seed Extract Astaxanthin CoQ10 Selenium methionine ( Plus we just started chelating with ALA only , and she seems to do exceptionally well on ALA ) . If people want to list more antioxidants , I 'd love to hear more . right now our DD is on nothing.. no supplements.. on DMSA days we give some but thats pretty much , we took her off because she was reacting badly to all the multi's.. i am not sure if it was getting overdose.. she seems to be doing better off of it , we will try to introduce back slowly _________________ DD 5.5 yrs ASD Limited Verbal
