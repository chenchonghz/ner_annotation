It works on the same idea as PECS ( in fact the pictures are PECS ) but the device models the words for him . That seems to be working for him at the moment and we are getting more speech . We also have him on a variety of biomedical supplements as behavior is a big issue for us too . Taurine at 500mgs three times a day helps and we have him on DMG which has been shown to help with speech . Since we started the DMG it has helped with spontaneous speech but it does have behavior issues that come with it . Luckily the Taurine seems to be keeping that to a minimum . Hi , what is DMG , what is your son 's daily dosage what behavioral issues are you seeing with it ? I had never heard of Taurine as being useful for speech production score , but I will try it and see , especially since you have had success with it . Thank you so much for sharing !
