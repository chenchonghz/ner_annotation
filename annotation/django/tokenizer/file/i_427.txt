I 'm thinking about starting my daughter on a B complex cream but I 'm not sure which brand would be best . I found this one by Sarati ( information below ) I like really like the fact that is less than $ 20.00 and I also like it because it has methylcobalamin and P5P but it also has lipoic acid and I 'm not sure if this will mess with AC chelation . We have done two rounds of DMSA only and will continue for at least 10 more rounds before we introduce ALA. Shall we try a b complex cream without the lipoic acid ? Do you guys think this ingredient in the cream could affect AC chelation ? Also , if you any of you are using the Lee Silsby B-complex cream , can you give me an approximate cost ? THANKS !
