Hi all . I have been reading alot about TTFD . I am wondering , is this the same thing as Vitamin B1 ( thiamin ) or is it something different ? Is the B1/Thiamine in Autistique cream the same as the TTFD in the Authia cream ? It does not mention anything about TTFD in the Autistique cream.. Anyway , if anyone can clarify this for me , I would really appreciate it ! Thanks all Jennifer _________________ My Autism Awareness Items http : //members.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dl ... id=jen25nc
