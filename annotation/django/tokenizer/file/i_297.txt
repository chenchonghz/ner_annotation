Hi again , On the creatine vs creatinine question , one needs to be careful here . YES , creatinine is a final byproduct of creatine metabolism . However , our bodies are very inefficient at using creatine monohydrate ( CM ) . Much of the ingested CM is destablized into creatinine before it ever gets out of the digestive system . What this means is when your Dr performs a blood test for creatinine , you will show elevated levels . Dr 's test for creatinine as a marker for a healthy functioning liver . SO insure you tell your Dr. that your child is supplementing with CM . Once again , I hope this helps . Cherokee
