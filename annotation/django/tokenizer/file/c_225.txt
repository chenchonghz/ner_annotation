boobear- Benadryl is an antihistamine used for allergies or to help sleep . I used it to help me sleep . I became quite `` addicted '' to it and had a hard time getting off . It 's not an `` addictive '' drug , but I guess it was for me . Here are it 's uses : PRESCRIBED FOR : Diphenhydramine is used for the relief of nasal and non-nasal symptoms of various allergic conditions such as seasonal allergic rhinitis . It is also used to treat patients with chronic urticaria . Although antihistamines are the preferred class of drugs in allergic rhinitis , they only reduce symptoms by 40-60 % . Diphenhydramine also is used for allergic reactions involving the eyes ( allergic conjunctivitis ) , to prevent or treat active motion sickness , and for mild cases of Parkinsonism , including drug-induced Parkinsonism . The last two uses ( motion sickness and Parkinsonism ) are based on the anticholinergic effects of diphenhydramine , and not its antihistamine effects . Diphenhydramine also is used as an aid for insomnia . I found this too ! ! I feel better ! PREGNANCY : Diphenhydramine has been used extensively in pregnant women ; the incidence of fetal malformations is the same as that which would be expected in women who are not taking medications . Additionally , studies in animals suggest no important effects on the fetus . Diphenhydramine , therefore , can be used in pregnancy if the physician feels that it is needed .
