My son only eats mini frozen pizzas, toasted bagels and peanut butter, chocolate chip cookies store bought only. He will only drink chocolate milk from his blue cup. He will drink any kind of juice but only from a juice box. He will eat waffels but only store bought with brown sugar and cut in quarters. He has been eating the same things for years. We have tried to introduce new foods as well. Not worth the screaming and fighting.- Sean PDD-Nos Age 10 Samamtha Age 11 proud Mom every day is a different adventure
