Hi , My son , nt , who is 14 , always had high cholesterol . I can remember at 7 years old it was 208 , and to this day , it still measures 208 . He does n't have a poor diet , well , he does like fast food once a week , but most people do . At home , he eats whatever we eat , and there is hardly any red meat or fatty foods involved.My daughter 's cholesterol was 140 , and mine is 160 . My hubby has over 200 also , so the pediatrician said that a lot of times high cholesterol is genetic.It 's great that you are pushing healthy foods , now the thing is getting him to eat it I 'm sure my asd son has high cholesterol because all he eats is chicken nuggets , entennmann 's mini muffins , green apples , chips , pizza and yogurt . Good luck with the new foods ! ! nakama
