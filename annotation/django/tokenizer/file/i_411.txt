I am more interested in understanding the significance of low plasma homocysteine status and how to correct that rather than the cysteine itself ( although understand that homocysteine gets converted to cysteine via the transulfuration pathway ) . I guess what I got out of the link RE low cysteine is that you could possibly raise it by eating high thiol foods on a consistent basis . Kinda like water soluble supplements ... .eat/take in divided doses throughout the day .
