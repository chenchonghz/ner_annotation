We are currently on round 4 . Cole 's older ( 11 ) so I know it could take more time , but so far , i have n't seen any changes . The first two rounds we did 8.3mg and now 12.5mg these last two rounds . Wondering if I should up it to 25mg next weekend or stay at 12.5mg for a while longer . Cole 's 84 pounds , so this dose is really low for him . I have n't been treating for yeast yet except for 2 Candidase in the AM and VSL3 and/or Culturelle before bed . I think I should add something for yeast but I 've just never really figured out the best thing for yeast , how much to give , etc . Maybe I 'll just do the Brainchild program so it 's all explained to me . _________________ Becky Cole - 11 Milo - 5
