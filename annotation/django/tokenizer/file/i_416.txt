Intuniv we could not live without . Our son takes the max 4 mg/day . The side effects were tired when he first started . It does nothing for focus , but was a miracle for hyperactivity , violent behaviors to himself and others , and temper tantrums . He can still get mildly hyper at times but the rest is completely gone . Yes , it 's the extended release version of tenex given only once a day versus twice , and he does n't have the ups and downs like he did on tenex ( starting tired , then increasingly hyper as it wore off ) . The side effects are sleeping without seroquel , potty trained rapidly , able to sit still to be taught , high frustration threshold , and generally MUCH happier . Nothing bad here , all good . He was cranky the first two weeks starting on tenex because it made him sleepy and he fought it . When he quit fighting it and started sleeping better , it was all good . ( We started on tenex and went to intuniv recently ) . I love his dmg and curcumin , but I 'd give up his talking for the peace intuniv brings !
