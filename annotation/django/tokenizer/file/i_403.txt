Wow , very interesting article ! I 'm wondering how would one know if Acetaldehyde was accumulating ? Is there any test for it ? I 'm very curious because both of my girls have tested off the charts for Molybdenum ( 0.75 with a ref range of 0.3 ) . Does anyone know if this would indicate that molybdenum is n't doing it 's job breaking down the yeast by-products ?
