Has anyone here ever used MMS ? We 've been using it for almost two weeks . My son seems happier and clearer the last few days . He ran up to me this morning and hugged my legs saying `` happy , happy , happy ! ! '' It was music to my ears ! ! ! My son 's DAN ! doctor wants us to start NDF+ and my question is , can you use MMS and NDF+ together ? MMS claims to remove bacteria , yeast and heavy metals . NDF+ works on removing heavy metals . Would n't they be too much to use at the same time ?
