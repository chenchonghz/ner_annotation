why does n't the doc address this ? the focus was the low carnitine . my gf 's daughter has arginine defe . and she was n't concerned about the number either ... she did tell me if he was tense during blood draw ammonia would be elevated . i only came across this b/c i was searching nac , which lead me to find high cysteine which jason has ... ..that you should n't supplement nac , cutler says to supp molybdenum ( sp ) which somehow i came across ammonia issues , caringdad says high taurine which jason has and ammonia means maybe cbs ? ? so , do i do the liver life , yasko ammonia or molybdenum ? jason 's labs : high taurine high cysteine low carnitine elevated ammonia liver function is ok thanks for any help , kristin - then i think i should go to a dan , but so many here say they 're dan is n't as helpful as this board
