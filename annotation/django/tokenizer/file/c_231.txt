( ( ( HugsforKaty ) ) ) My 4 1/2 year old son is on the exact same meds . He started off on 10mg of Focalin XR 6 months ago along with .5 mg of Clonodine at night . He is now taking 20mg of Focalin XR and .1 mg of Clonodine at night ( his ADHD is very severe ) and I am here to tell ya , it is WONDERFUL ! ! In the beginning , I was concerned just like you , although I completely trusted his doctor , I checked with a few more and 3 different pharmacists as well . From what I was told.. The Focalin is a central nervous system stimulant and that is to help with the ADHD , and the Clonodine is a VERY mild blood pressure medication that is used very often to help them come down completely from the stimulants in order to sleep , but is not enough to cause a severe blood pressure drop due to the stimulant raising the blood pressure a bit above normal to begin with . I have had a world of luck using these meds , and feel very comfortable telling you that its ok. You little darling will be just fine , and while taking those meds , the doctor will also keep a very close check on blood pressure , will be checking periodically liver and kidney functions via bloodwork . You have nothing to worry about , but I completely understand your concerns.If you have anymore questions , PLEASE feel free to PM me anytime.Hope this helps you . - Skylar ( 5 ) HFA/Sev.ADHD Zoe ( 8 ) ADD/Anxiety Dis .
