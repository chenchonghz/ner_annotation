Our DAN has us give Acetyl L-Carnitine 1000 mg in the AM and L-Carnitine 1000mg after the evening meal ( both AM and PM meals should have a decent amount of fat so body can digest it with the aid if these supplements ) . Best of luck . _________________ ******************************** Mom to recovering ASD boy - 5yrs
