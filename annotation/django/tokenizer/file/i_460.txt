http : //www.drmyhill.co.uk/wiki/CFS_-_Th ... to_support There are four cornerstones to the methylation cycle and on each cornerstone sit four molecules namely homocysteine , methionine , S-adenosylmethionine ( SAMe ) and S-adenosylhomocysteine . Each of these molecules leads into the next one by means of enzymes . The important co-factors that allow this to happen are the B vitamins such as folic acid , vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 . In converting from S-adenosyl methionine into S-adenosyl homocysteine , a methyl group is given up and this can be used to stick on to other molecules - hence the name , the methylation cycle . However , there is a particular bio-chemical glitch here . In order for the methylation cycle to work these B vitamins have to be in their activated form , namely methylcobalamin , folinic acid and pyridoxyl-5-phosphate . In order to get cobalamin into methylcobalamin , the methylation cycle has to be working . So if this cycle has crashed completely , the body ca n't make methyl cobalamin in order to get it up and running again . Since this cycle is so fundamental to other biochemical cycles including trans-sulphuration and folate metabolism , it ca n't change the vitamin B6 , folic acid and cobalamin into the active forms necessary for the methylation cycles to work . This means that in order to get this cycle up and running initially we have to prime the pump with the activated vitamins , but hopefully once the methylation cycle is up and running , it can function on the vitamins in their normal states . http : //mthfr.net/taking-folate-and-feel ... 011/11/15/ more in depth http : //www.enzymestuff.com/methylation.htm http : //www.slideshare.net/bdiconza33/me ... lymorphism
