What happened around the time she regressed within a month or two . Did she have any type of an illness like a flu , chicken pox , a cold sore etc ? Was she vaccinated around that time ? I ask because in cases of regressive autism , viruses or even parasites could be a possibility . Have you done testing for viral titers or parasites ? My son stopped progressing after MMR vaccine ( he tested high for measle titers ) but my daughter was a regresser . She tested for HHV6 ( roseola ) which she caught at 10 months and her regression started around 12 months and by 14 months we were sure something was wrong . We did antivirals for both children . They both developed the healing rash . We saw subtle improvements with GFCF and the typical Dan ! supplements but the 3 things we did that recovered our kids were Specific Carbohydrate Diet , Antivirals and Homeopathy , ( zinc and vitamins and probiotics have been important as well . ) I tell everyone to try those things and they wo n't be disappointed . You will see results within the first 2 weeks on SCD and immediately with homeopathy and about 1-2 months with antivirals ( if your child is a viral kid ) . I am a Rescue Angel for Generation Rescue and those timeframes are not only for both my kids but that is about average reports from the families I have worked with . _________________ Niko- Age 4.3 Recovered from ASD Ilianna- Age 2.10 Recovered from PDD-NOS and Severe Gut problems
