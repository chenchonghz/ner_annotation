I wonder , if a child is infected with one of these organisms , if this would cause a depletion of say , Lysine ( which helps the body make antibodies to fight off virus infection ) if it would cause , at the time of illness or vaccination , a child with these infections will not have any usable lysine to not only make proper antibodies to the virus/vaccine , but it will alter how the body 's immune system functions in general ? Just a thought . I know metals have ionic charges attached to them , like calcium I believe . I wonder how much the bacteria are also using vital minerals or even heavy metals to help with this ionic charge as well ... to become resistant ? Like aluminum in vaccines ... since the body clears this stuff from the bloodstream into the liver and then intestines for disposal ... allowing better resistance of these microbes during vaccinations early in life when a child is forming their gut flora ? Copper has a charge to it for sure , that 's why it 's used to make electricity . Two things . My doctor had me take lysine to rebuild my immunity during and after my heavy antibiotic treatment for lyme ( I was unfortunate to have mono at the same time as well , which is why mine progressed to stage 2 , so that may be part of it ) I have never had a resistant bacterial infection or clostridia . The 2nd is that bacteria does hide behind mercury , and I am not sure of evidence for other minerals , so I wo n't speak on that . _________________ Mimi http : //cadesmom.wordpress.com/
