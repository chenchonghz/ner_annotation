What kicked up the spontaneous speech for us lately was astaxanthin ... I think it was 2 days after I started it , she started telling me she was bored and wanted to go out . She had ok vocal imitation after being on R5P for about 2 months but when I added astaxanthin ( and when I increased other antioxidants ) , we got some spontaneous speech . We 're still in the very early phases of spontaneous speech and there is still the apraxia to contend with and I sometimes still need to help her find her words . We had less spontaneous speech today -- maybe because I screwed up our first round 36 hours in ... long story , alarm mishap . But she was pretty incredible while she was on her round . It was Sunday and we drove by her school and we had reviewed the days of the week earlier in the day and she already knew it was Sunday . We drove by her school on the way to somewhere else , my husband asked her , Do you think Mrs. XYZ ( her teacher ) is at school today ? Maia answered , Nooo . I asked her , Why ? and she answered , Betause iss Sundeh . Daddy almost fell over . I 'm just re-starting the round today and again , increased spontaneous speech about an hour after her first dose of ALA . I 'm thinking it might be antioxidants , although astaxanthin also has anti-inflammatory properties , which I suspect plays a role , too . But , because she 's also seeming to do really well on ALA , I 'm suspecting antioxidants really do it for her . She does n't tolerate Vit C in higher doses , but I also get more spontaneous speech ( single words ) from my son with higher doses of Vit C. With the astaxanthin , I give it right after I give her ALCAR . I give the astaxanthin at about 3-4 mg/day , I mix it in with her EFAs and CoQ10 . I give it right after the ALCAR because ALCAR helps to metabolize fats . _________________ Alberta
