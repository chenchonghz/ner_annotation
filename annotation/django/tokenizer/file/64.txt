I am not sure about the AI thing. My son has mod/severe autism and I haven't heard anything about that. He is still in preschool so maybe it is different in grade school but we are in Kansas and that hasn't been brought up at all. As far as I can tell he doesn't get any special treatment because he is autistic. He gets speech therapy and they do some ABA but he doesn't get hours and hours of it week...more like 2-3 hours a week with a speech therapist and the rest of the time in special education preschool. It seems that a lot depends on the school district. They have been great but made it clear from the start that they wouldn't pay for full on ABA one to one which is what the child psych recommended originally. Do you know where you will live? I used to have the name of an advocate in the area but she no longer works in the area. - Heather  Mom of 6yo son with mod/sev Autism and severe hemophilia. Mom of 10 yo daughter.
