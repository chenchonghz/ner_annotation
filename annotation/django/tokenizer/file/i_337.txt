quercetin prevents the body from making histamines so no reactions . My daughter is severely allergic to cats she came home from her friends house barely able to breathe eyes swollen and watering . Next time she wanted to go over I had her take a quercetin capsule and she was fine . She can go over and play for hours she usually only has to take one about every other day . Although she still ca n't spend the night with only one pill . I 'm thinking about trying it again with a second dose just before bed and seeing if that will allow her to spend the night . And I used to get seasonal allergies - not any more same reason a quercetin about every other day sometimes everyday if the allergy report says pollen is extremely high and it is an anti inflamatory so everyday is fine for me . I hope this helps .
