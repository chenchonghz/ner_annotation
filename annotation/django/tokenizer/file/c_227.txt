We 've already contacted a lawyer . I took Terbutaline from 24 weeks until the twins were born . It would n't be a class action lawsuit against the drug manufacturer . They did n't do anything wrong . It 's the doctors who have n't paid attention to the FDA 's warnings dating back to 1997 that need to be sued ! ! Terbutaline is an asthma medication that is commonly used to treat preterm labor . Terbutaline is sold under the brand names Brethine and Bricanyl . Recent studies have shown a link between the use of Terbutaline during pregnancy and an increased risk of brain damage and cognitive deficits in the baby . A recent study conducted at Duke University illustrated the risk of Terbutaline to infants . The study showed that the use of Terbutaline might leave the brains of children susceptible to other chemicals ubiquitously present in the environment . The study suggests that certain early drug or chemical exposures can predispose people to particular ailments . Recently , the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program has recommended that Terbutaline no longer be given to women with mild intermittent asthma while they are pregnant . As early as 1997 the FDA issued its first warning about the use of Terbutaline Sulfate for the treatment and prevention of preterm labor . Terbutaline sulfate , in various dosage forms , has been approved by FDA for the treatment of asthma but it has be given to pregnant women subcutaneously , to stop early labor . The use of Terbutaline sulfate to treat preterm labor is an unapproved or `` off-label '' use . Premature labor occurs in approximately 20 percent of all pregnancies in the United States . Of those , an estimated 1 million women annually are treated with Terbutaline or related drugs to halt the early contractions . The drugs administered to pregnant women also penetrate to the unborn baby where they affect brain development .
