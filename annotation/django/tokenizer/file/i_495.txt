Anti-virals suppress viruses and/or prevent them from multiplying . Most anti-viral remedies do not actually kill the viruses . Examples of anti-virals include Valtrex , ViraStop , and Olive Leaf Extract ( OLE ) . Examples of anti-fungals are Diflucan , Nystatin , Uva Ursi , and Grapefruit Seed Extract ( GSE ) . Actually GSE supposedly has some anti-viral properties as well . To the best of my knowledge , Dr. Krigsman prescribes neither anti-virals nor anti-fungals for ASD kids . With ASD kids , he uses anti-inflammatory medications . Thank you !
