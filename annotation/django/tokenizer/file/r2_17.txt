I work for an inventory company , basically counting merchandise for all kinds of different stores . Anyway , the reason I come on here is to alert people about a situation with Bath and Body Works.The inventory company has an autistic employee that works for us . He 's a very good worker and we make sure to treat him just like anyone else.Anyway , this employee was counting at a Bath and Body Works and by all accounts doing a good job . But the manager at that BBW store ( and their corporate HQ ) do n't like that someone with autism is counting in their store . They told the inventory company `` We do n't want people like that in our stores . `` So i figured I would relay that to you and maybe get the word out not to shop at Bath and Body Works . I was n't sure where to go , so I googled autism message boards and found this site . Hopefully the members here can spread the word . Let me know if you think this would be an appropriate response .
