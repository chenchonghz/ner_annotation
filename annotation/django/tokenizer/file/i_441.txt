We use it here . Bought the Neuroflow off ebay . We are n't using it for the nootropic properties although that is a plus , but rather to help push out metals , specifically cadmium . There are some studies that show that high dose vitamin C and thiamine are able to push out intracellular metals including cadmium and lead . As far as a nootropic effect , we do n't see very much of that . I would assume that if you were low in B1 then this might be more profound . I personally have also tried high dose regular B1 for a nootropic effect ( 500mg 3x day ) and it is about the same as the sulbutiamine . Sulbutiamine is lipophilic and particularly good at raising B1 levels in the brain which should be good for neuroprotective effects . _________________ No scientific evidence that autism has a toxic or allergic basis . - Mr. Barrett
