I have a 4 year old son diagnosed last year with Autism . He was non verbal last year but now speaks ( lots of scripting ) . Doing the Biomedical since last March . Started him on HBOT 2 weeks ago ( have done 28 dives so far ) . Seems that he 's been a lot more hyper and has been acting very silly and giggles a lot for no apparent reason . I have a strong feeling that he might have yeast ( we did a stool test last week and have not gotten results yet ) but from reading other posts kids that do HBOT are usually on some type of yeast protocol . Called our DAN today to see if we can get him on one . Can it be a die off reaction that he 's acting like this ? ? ? He was diagnosed with PANDAS in January and is on Zithromax ( 250 mg capsule ) once a week for the next few months . Here 's a list of supplements he 's on : Pro Omega 3 ( 1/2 tsp , 2x day ) Super Nuthera ( 1 capsule , 2x ) Probiotic ( 1 capsule , 2x ) Cod Liver Oil ( 1 tsp , 3x ) giving him so he gets more Vit . A Vitamin C ( 1/4 tsp , 2x ) Aqua E ( 2 tsp , 2x ) Mag Sulfate Cream ( 1 gram 2x ) Calcium Powder ( 1/2 tsp 1x ) CoQ Plus 50 ( 1 gelcap 2x ) Carnitine ( 2 capsule , 2x ) DMG ( 1 tsp , 3x ) BH4-Bioptorin ( 1 tab daily ) Methylfolate ( 4 capsule , 2x ) Vitamin B6 ( 1 capsule , 1x ) Pycnogenol ( 2 capsule , 2x ) Prim Royal ( 2 capsule , 2x ) P5P ( 1 capsule , 2x ) Enhansa ( 150mg 2x day ) Liquid Zinc ( 1 1/2 tsp , 1x bedtime ) Liquid Iron ( 1/2 tsp , daily ) Vitamin D ( 2 drops am/1 drop pm Sac .

He 's very small for his age ( 31 lbs ) . Any suggestions on how to increase his weight ? Feel like we 've taken 10 steps backwards lately . Any advice would be very much appreciated .
