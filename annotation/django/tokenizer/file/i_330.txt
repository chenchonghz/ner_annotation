Just wanted to note that there is a difference between Acetyl L Carnitine and L Carnitine . The way my DAN explained it , L Carnitine fuels the body and Acetyl L Carnitine fuels the brain . I think someone asked about liquid Carnitine . I have only seen L Carnitine , not the Acetyl . I also remember hearing somewhere that COQ10 is fat soluble , so should be given with some fats ( meal , fish oil ) . We are doing 500 mg Acetyl L Carnitine twice daily and 60 mg COQ10 twice daily ( given together ) . My son is 4 and 45 pounds . _________________ 'Sometimes , ' said Pooh , 'the smallest things take up the most room in your heart . '
