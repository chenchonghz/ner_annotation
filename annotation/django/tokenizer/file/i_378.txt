My HF 4yo was historically prone to constipation , but since trying to attack yeast with antifungals last year he now alternates between regularly formed stools ( more often ) and sometimes mush . Today I started adding 5-MTHF to his vitamin mixture . He already gets ~600mcg from the Lee Silsby DRN vitamin/mineral powder . Today I gave him ~1/4 of a 1000mcg capsule of the 5-MTHF ( Thorne brand ) and our DAN wants us to work up to a full capsule daily . His stool today , several hours after the 5-MTHF , was very mushy , much more so thatn I 've seen in awhile . Can 5-MTHF casue mushy stools , or could it have been a coincidence ? I hate questioning every little thing , especially when my list of little things to do is so long ! Thanks ! _________________ Sharon , mom to Nathan , 2/28/05 Silent Reflux since 6 wks old Dx : PDD-NOS Enterocolitis
