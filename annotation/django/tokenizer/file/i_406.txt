JeniB . How do you think that the VSL3 helps with strep in the body when it has a large amount of strep strain in it ? I am not tryig to be a ass I am just trying to figure out what is going on with my boy . This is the story let me know what you think and give me any advice you have . Jan. 13 started VSL3 as per DAN 1 cap . Jan 15 started supp . chelation Jan 17 started slight echoing again . ( was gone ) Jan 19 bad batch of MB12 by Feb 6 huge increase in echo , hyperactivity , Huge increase in OCD ( severe ) not beig able to call him his name , adding T 's to the end of words , bed wetting , obsessive about food and drink . Breakout of caker sores in mouth Stopped chelation.. Feb 22 unable to sit still , trying to get out of the car seat.. Live blood cell test shows clear of yeast ad bacteria . Feb 23 2 cofirmed cases of scarlet fever and 3 cases of strep throat at daycare . Feb 24 comes down with a cold ( never gets sick ) March 6 everything still there , missing daycare because ocd so bad he is pushig other children when they try to play with a toy he is ocd over . slight rash all over body and around face . March 14 stop VSL3 after reading that strep strains can possible be a problem for children with PANDAS . Today alittle better , but not even close to where he was prior to Jan 13 . I have started inositol and cats claw trying to help with the ocd.. I would bet everything that I own that he has PANDAS . My DAN has been out of town the last 2 weeks and I have a phone consult on tues . I just pray that he responds to antibiotics . Any advice from anyone would be great if you think there is a another direction that I should be looking ... . TIA , Stacy
