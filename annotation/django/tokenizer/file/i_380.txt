After about 3-6 months , you might be able to switch from SAMe to the cheaper methionine in order to encourage the methylation cycle via the 'long way . ' First , there is methionine which converts to SAMe which in turn converts to S-Adenosyl Homocysteine which then turns into Homocysteine which via B12 and Folic ( specifically 5-MTHF ) recycles back to Methionine . This is the 'long way . ' Remember , when you are using TMG , phosphatidylserine , DMAE you are encouraging the shortcut via the BHMT enzyme pathway . This 'shortcut ' enables you to go from Homocysteine directly back to methionine . This can be helpful to get the cycle running , but this enzymatic path can be stressed , overloaded with too much methylation support . You can tell this is the case because your urine organic acids/neurotransmitter tests will show a shift of higher vanilmandelic acid ( VMA ) relative to homovanillic acid ( HVA ) . This can mean that the methylation cycle is receiving enough if not excessive support via the BHMT route . Therefore , you can carefully add in Dimethylglycine ( DMG ) in order to take some of the strain off the BHMT route and also , to begin encouraging the shift towards the 'long way . ' It is tricky to balance the methylation support .
