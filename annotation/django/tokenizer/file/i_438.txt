omamma ./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif Just to add I have been doing some research on Dr Ks method of detox for ASD/KPU sufferers : He says to start KPU minerals after the child has been detoxing for around 6-8 months/30-50 sessions He mentions DMSA another one . In my childs case itll be DMSA ALA. Then you start giving the KPU supplement . He then says additionally to this , you should add another binder such as microsilica ( more gentle , but more effective and powerful than DMSA ) on the off days of chelation when giving KPU Minerals . He said one should give their child this from 4-13 times per day depending on the severity of the healing crisis symptoms . ( Stims , runny stools , nausea etc ) I plan to chelate 3 days per week every 3 hours as per usual and add the microsilica as needed for back up support when adding the KPU minerals in after session 10 when I start ALA . Complicated but I think I have figured it out in my toxic brain LOL I have posted the transcript on my thread my child tested positive for KPU All the best ! xx _________________ Daughter 5y.o lost diagnosis - 100 rounds cutler .
