Hi Rachel , I just have to say I 've tried a little bit of everything ... .but recently I added a supplement called Mental Effort made by a company called Your Vitamins.com . It 's less expensive if you purchase from HSN.com ( I 've been taking this brand vitamins myself for a LONG time and although pricy , the ingredients are PURE with NO additives like cellulose etc . ) This Mental Effort product has made a difference for my kids ( it has Vinpocetine , Bacopa , Huperzine A , Pregnenolone and Ginkgo ) as well as the Phosphatidyl Serine I recently started them on . Yes , I 'm using the Ojibwa tea but I 'm not following the recommended directions . I just add some tea to their breakfast cereal otherwise , they wo n't drink it . Jessica only drinks water so I ca n't sneak any stuff in on her that way . With Luke , I can put some tea in his juice . I hope this tea is doing something as it it very difficult to brew ! Many restrictions and things like that ! ( Ca n't even microwave it , but I 've given up my microwave for everything but emergencies anyway . ) Anyway , they also get ST on Tues and Thurs for 30 min in addition to the ST and OT at preschool . Old Dominion University has a child study center that has excellent ST at reduced prices and it 's really been great for us and they 've made SO much progress ! We can see it because they video EVERY session ! I could n't believe the progress they both made from the summer to the fall . Jessica was really like night and day . Even the director came to me at the end of the first session this fall and wanted to know what I was doing with them . She said her dogs Vet has a son who is ASD and she wanted to pass my info on to her . So I 'm basically just tring to keep up with the supplements , combat the yeast and chelate . Also just trying to play with them as much as I can . I 'm still trying to teach them to take turns . I just wish I could clone myself sometimes . I 'd love to be able to cook and play with them at the same time ... ... ./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif We also found out recently that Jessica has a bacteria problem and is now on Flagyl so we 'll see how she does on that . Take care , _________________ Save 5.00 on 1st order code VEG287 http : //www.iherb.com/ *Twins*
