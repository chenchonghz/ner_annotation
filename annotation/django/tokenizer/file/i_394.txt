Hi , all . I 'm new to this forum . My 4 y/o son was diagnosed with autism this summer by our ped , who coincidentally is a DAN dr , and we immediately started on the biomedical journey . I 've known something was wrong with him from the beginning ( a few weeks old ) , so I 'm relieved to finally know what it is and how to treat it ! ! DS is supposed to be on 20mg of zinc picolinate ( the bioavailable form of zinc ) daily . I can not find it anywhere ! I 've found 25mg of zinc picolinate at Vitacost - and of course it has some chemicals in it that I 'd prefer to stay away from , but hey it 's the closest to what I 'm looking for , so I am buying it until I can find something better . I 'm dumping 1/5 of the capsule into the trash , so that he gets only the 20mg ( since his dr says 25mg is too much ) . ( I sprinkle the contents of the capsule into his food , b/c he does n't swallow capsules/tablets yet . ) I have googled like crazy , trying to find any other zinc picolinate ( in a capsule/powder - NOT a tablet ) anywhere around 20-25mg ... and I just ca n't find it . I am reading here that some of you use liquid zinc . Is it zinc picolinate ? Do you know where I can find 20mg of zinc picolinate ? Thanks ! ./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif
