Hey,   Aussiemom - glad to hear that you've had postive results with the chelation therapy, but what type of chelation therapy did you make use of? I understand that you used the oral form, but which compund did you make use of?  I ask because there are some people who have chelation therapy using EDTA while other people have chelation therapy using DMSA. Both groups of people seem to be adament that the type that they used was the best or rather the most beneficial. I'm interestd in what the differences are between the two types. Can anyone enlighten me about that? -  Chelation Therapy products
