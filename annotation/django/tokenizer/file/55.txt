naebr, that is exactly my feeling on trying different things cause each medication will effect each child differently. When we first tried catapress (which is the same as chlonadine but in a patch form) my daughter kept pulling off the patch. We then switched to the pill and she also was wetting her bed but more important than that it did not help her symptoms and made them worse. Between the natural drops we are using and vitimin B, we do see an improvement, however some days are inconsistant. She is not agressive by has alot impulse control issues and self stimming.
