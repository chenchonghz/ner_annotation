I think the dr wants to use the nicotine patch to address inflammation issues in my son . The two things we focused on discussing during the last visit were stress , stress , stress ( from neuroscience test results ) and at the end he lightly touched on inflammation spoke of the nicotine patch as one of a quintet of things he uses for stress inflammation , etc for me to look up info about so I can best be prepared before the next office visit . I already do n't want him getting one other of this `` quintet '' of 5 ( namenda ) -- told him that the wk before so I feel like I 'm not going along with the dr very well , as I 've already vetoed one , but now he 's saying it again -- -that I should be using it ( namenda ) for him as one of this quintet . Then the other one I do n't want is the nicotine patch-just introduced last Friday as what he wants to do . I want my son to get better , for SURE ! But this makes me feel so disconcerted , apprehensive ... Would n't even a small amount of nicotine be addictive , for example ? Then , how would you ease off of it ? I read in another place that the patch does n't give out the medication evenly -- so another negative/problem regarding that one . What about the glue from the patch on skin that 's prone to eczema ( my son 's ) . Other people 's posts I 've read say their kid had nausea from it/one person said their child had insomnia . Pluses -- One person gave it a huge plus for inflammation . The main thing I keep reading is that it improves focus attention ( not my son 's issues , though ) The dr. wants to use it for inflammation with my son as this is a huge issue for him . Sigh , sigh -- -- - I just want to have a ton of money come my way do ( dramatic pause ) mhbot . ./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif That 's what I want to do . And THAT would take care of his inflammation ! ! But today it 's not an option . ./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif
