I know currently JeniB is having such schedule ( JeniB - I sent you a PM ) . I have a feeling that my kid needs as much DMSA as ALA and I 'm planning to alternate DMSA only rounds with DMSA+ALA when i get to a point to add ALA , right now I 'm only on DMSA . All I want to know is does switching or doing DMSA only with DMSA+ALA be beneficial ? Any advice from your experience is appreciated . Keep in mind that we have been chelating for a long time -- a year of IV suppositories , and a year ( 50 rounds ) of AC , so my son has moved a lot of metal . When we started on AC last year , we did DMSA for probably 4 or 6 rounds , then added ALA . When we began to notice that his neutrophils were low , we switched to ALA 3X mo. , and using ALA+DMSA 1X mo . After you 've cleared a lot of lead with the DMSA , you only have to use it 1X a month or so , because it lifts from the bones . That said , DMSA helps with some of the side effects from ALA , which removes Hg from the brain and central nervous system . People can become somewhat spacey/euphoric on ALA only . DMSA can temper those responses . My son is fine on ALA only until day 3 ( say Sunday afternoon , after having begun a round on Fri. afternoon ) then he can get somewhat flighty , and a bit emotional , i.e . low frustration level . Some people can do longer rounds , my son still can go past 72 hours comfortably . We keep adjusting and tweeking , and you will too . ./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif
