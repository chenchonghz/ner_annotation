Hi Jen Thanks for your comments . Truly appreciate . My son 's speech stopped completely after we started supplements . Earlier he had little bit of speech . I suspect B6 ( without adequate B1 ) might have stopped his speech . Now he speaks only when he is stressed or very excited otherwise he is completely silent . I 'll start supplement B1 - I have read in your other post you suggested that B1 needs to have folate and Magnesium for working effectively . Can you please advise which brand for B1 you find better ? I am also thinking to add 5MTHF before B1 . Following are results from my kid 's recent UEE test : Potassium - 41 ( ref 30 - 250 ) Calcium - 80 ( ref 30 - 300 ) Phosphorus - 1680 ( ref 300 - 2200 ) Sodium - 210 ( ref 45 - 350 ) My kid does n't drink water or liquid much . Not sure whether he feels thirsty . Somedays he even goes without any water . My son 's Methioine and Cysteine levels are consistently low on two Amino acids tests two months apart . Would like to introduce Methioine at some stage . Thanks Jen . Ajit
