Hello , I am a mom of a 9 year old boy who does not have Autism but he has other disorders which prompted me to seek a naturopath instead of conventional doctors . He has a tic disorder , ADD , GAD , OCD , and some learning disabilities . The doctor put him on Kavinace back in May after we did the Neuroscience testing . He was high in Dopamine but low in Serotonin ( I do n't remember the others per se ) . The Kavinace took away his OCD within 2 days ! Then she put him on the Travacor JR and we had the OCD return along with some new tics . So , I took him off of it and the OCD went away but the tic took longer to disappear . Anyway , my question is this : I noticed that Kavinace has phynelbute as an amino acid blend with taurine . Phynelbute has some pretty nasty withdrawl symptoms . Has anyone experienced withdrawl from any of the Neuroscience products ? Also , do you hit a period where they are n't as effective and where the body builds up tolerance to the supplement ? I am a bit concerned about these things but at the same time I 'm happy to have my child back . His OCD is primarily religious scrupulosity and obsessive worry that distressed him to the point of crying jags all day long and fear that literally scared me and my dh . Also , we were told to put ds on the Endotrex spray which is all L-theanine and I found that it increased mouth tics in him . I told the naturopath that I found this and she said it was strange . I told her that I was reading that theanine increases dopamine and that dopamine increases tics . She did n't believe me even after I sent her links to websites online . So , I 'm still not giving him the Travacor JR or the Endotrex b/c of the tics . Thanks , Bonnie
