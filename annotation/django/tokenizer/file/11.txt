We are doing DMSA and lupron . We also are on NDF , B12 , DMG and all the other suppliments . Yes my son also will take DMSA and dmg and CLO etc ... literally ask for it and eat it , and sometimes will ask for it right after eating it ... and if he does n't get it , he will cry . He almost shows his butt for shots . And yes getting tylenol into him will be a near impossible task , but tylenol is bad for him , it kills liver function , maybe he knows that instinctively . Open the capsule and eat DMSA from a spoon . Yes he does that . We have seen great results from them all . We have 5 1/2 weeks of Lupron DMSA and its already been a sharp improvement .
