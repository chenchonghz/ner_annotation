Exposure to increased pressure or hyperbaric oxygen suppresses interferon- secretion in whole blood cultures of health humans . Undersea Hyperb Med 2002 ; 29 ( 3 ) :216-25 . In the above article , HBOT at 2 atmosphere ( atm ) and 100 % oxygen , and hyperbaric pressure at 2 atm and 10.5 % oxygen ( thus supplying 21 % oxygen , equal to room air oxygen ) both showed anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting IFN- release , whereas 100 % oxygen at room air pressure ( 1 atm ) actually increased IFN- release Rick , please note that my question about `` pressure effect '' is specific about ~1.29 ATA . Dr. Granowitz ( who I contacted ) suggested it as a possible mechanism for anti-inflammatory effect , but this small study was conducted at 2.o ATA ( a significant pressure increase compared to the ~0.29 ATA increase afforded by the Vitaeris 320 ) and was of healthy human subjects . Additionally the study I posted , although in-vivo and at 2.4ATA , clearly shows that there was no effect of pressure alone on cytokine synthesis , which is what Dr. N had posited in the first place . FTR , I can see plausibility in increased oxygen tension providing benefit ( albeit probably small when you weigh in the role of hemoglobin compared to plasma at low pressures ) . My point is simply that if there really is n't any aspect of `` pressure effect '' alone at ~1.29 ATA , that this is going to be great for a lot of parents who might not be able to afford mHBOT , because it means that simple ( inexpensive ) O2 therapy might acheive the same benefit ( increased O2 tension ) as mHBOT ( without a mask ) . _________________ Do'C is a nickname , not a physician .
