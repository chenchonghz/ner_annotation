Yes he has been on Prozac for three years and risperdal for 6years . We increased his Prozac to 40mg . the end of last school year , because he did not want to go to school and the Doctor thought his anxiety was the problem . Last week we increased his risperdal to 4mg , this summer he was taking 3mg and he was ok. We go back to Doctor this Thur . and will probably go up to 5mg . I just called the Doctor to report the increase in risperdal is having no effect that we can notice . I am waiting to see if they call me back and want us to start the increase now . - mom to 13 year old boy with aspergers
