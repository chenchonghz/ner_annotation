My middle son had his first real attack , at about 18 months . For years he was on flovent twice a day , albuterol every 4 hrs round the clock and prednisone on a month then off for a bit then on etc . He is exercise and allergy induced . He still takes flovent twice a day and albuterol at school before gym class and long recess . None of the allergy medicines seemed to make any difference with him . He is 8 now . I can tell you , the combo of the albuterol and prednisone made him so hyper , poor thing . That was the worst side effect . Once he hit 5 , his attacks really went way down . Unless it 's really hot and humid , he does pretty good now with the `` maintenance . '' It really is scary , is n't it ? Hang in there . Oh , and we have had the nebulizer since day one , also . It really works well for attacks . I think it helps him mentally as well , helps him calm down and not panic . If that makes any sense . - jan mom/grandma to dd 15 ds 12 ds 7 dx autism and grown up kids 33 and 31
