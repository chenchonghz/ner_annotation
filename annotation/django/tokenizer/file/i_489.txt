I used to try NeuroPS from Vitaminworld but it seems that does n't help my son much . After switching to ISO Phos , 100 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the eve . It helps my son a lot in understanding the reason . I plan to give him 200mg/day for 3 months . Then , 100mg/day for 6 months . My son has been on PC , Phoschol , 3000 mg/day + Iso PS 200 mg/day Also , Methylfolate 1000mg .
