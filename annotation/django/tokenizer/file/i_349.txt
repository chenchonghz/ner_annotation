I was never told to keep the GFSE away from probiotics ! He gets one ProBio Gold in the AM and one before bed . He also gets 1 capsule of GFSE a day - 1/2 in the AM and 1/2 at dinner time . So obviously I should be keeping GFSE away from his probiotics ? Ahhhhhh - it 's so hard to keep things straight on what you can and can not give together ... . _________________ Mybuddy12
