I think that if you tell your doctors that you are using Sound wave therapy or something like it they will have more for you. I find that my doctor does not know anything but how to suggest prescription drugs for the situation. It is sad. I asked the pediatrician about acidophoulous while using antibiotics, he didn't even know how to dose it because it is not FDA approved... Please email!
