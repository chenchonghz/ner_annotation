Do n't worry about how it sounds , we know what you mean ./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif . You know , one of the NIH studies in the works , if I 'm not mistaken , is doxycycline in autism . I do n't know why exactly they picked this one , anyone has the links ? Interestingly the antimicrobial spectrum of zithromax and doxy are n't that different , though I 'm not sure if the benefit is supposed to be from antimicrobial action or from some type of immune system stimulation ( which zithro has ) . Have you looked into the possibility of a short Zithro course on a regular basis ? At least you know what to do if someday you have GOT to have him function at optimal parameters . I wish I could find something similar for ds ! Alex 's mom _________________ `` When many cures are offered for a disease , it means the disease is not curable '' -Anton Chekhov
