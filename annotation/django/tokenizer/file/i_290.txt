We started off with one DAN and switched to another a year later . Both required lab results before giving us the supps or modifying it . I really feel it is important for a DAN to do tests before prescribing certain minerals . There are things you can take that are safe for any person to consume such as CLO , Vit C , Probiotics and even digestive enzymes . I have 2 kids so it would be too complicated to provide everything in order to child so I am just going to list them as I remember them : Mini-minerals Zinc , Selenium , Calcium , Magnesium Cal-Mag ImmunoKids PureKids Grapeseed capsule Klaire probiotics Custom probiotics Houston Nutraceuticals AFP Peptizyde Digest Right or Kirkmans DPPIV Buffered Vit C DMG Nordic Naturals DHA Jr . Liquid Flaxseed oil Acai SNT B-Complex transdermal from Lee Silsby Methionine Capsules That is all I can remember at this time w/o the supps in front of me or my list .
