continued , I may or may not have Pervasive Developmental Disorder , but I do n't have full range of disorder fortunaely . I may or may not have absence seizures . There are many patterns and types about it and it is hardly difficult to find it easily . I do n't take it serious . I do n't need any counseling and medication like SSRI or other related medication except minor tranqulizer and sleeping meds . I 've been medicated since 40 years old with minor tranquilzer and sleeping meds and I am satisfy with it . Who knows my brain inside ? I lived 53 years already and I worked very hard without medication . I did everything what I wanted to do .
