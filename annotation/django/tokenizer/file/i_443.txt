Just thought - would it would be good if you are breast feeding to take the everything spectrum mutli vit ? In theory this should have more of the things I want to ensure the baby gets than a standard breast feeding vitamin ? Or are some things in to high a dose for the baby ( for example there is no vit A in my breastfeeding supplements ) Amount Per 3 Capsules Vitamin A ( as vitamin A palmitate ) 2,500 I.U . Vitamin D3 ( as cholecaliciferol ) 1,000 I.U . Vitamin K1 ( as phytonadione ) 50 mcg Thiamine ( as thiamine hydrochloride USP ) 12 mg Riboflavin USP 12 mg Niacin ( as niacinamide USP ) 36 mg Vitamin B6 ( as pyridoxine hydrochloride USP ) 12 mg Folic Acid USP 400 mcg Vitamin B12 ( as methylcobalamin ) 50 mcg Biotin USP 300 mcg Pantothenic acid ( as d-calcium pantothenate USP ) 50 mg Calcium ( as calcium citrate ) 300 mg Iodine ( from kelp ) 150 mcg Zinc ( as zinc glycinate chelate** ) 20 mg Selenium ( as selenium amino acid complex ) 100 mcg Chromium ( as chromium nicotinate glycinate chelate** ) Molybdenum ( as molybdenum glycinate chelate** ) 100 mcg Potassium ( as potassium chloride ) 45 mg Boron ( as boron aspartate-citrate ) 2 mg * Vanadium ( as bis-glycinato oxovanadium ) 50 mcg * Choline ( as choline bitartrate ) 50 mg * Inositol 50 mg * *Daily Value not established .
