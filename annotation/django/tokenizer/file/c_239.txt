We have never actually gone to a DAN doctor , but are now trying supplements with my son . We started DMG with B12 and Folinic acid about four months ago and we saw dramatic improvement in of all things , my son 's allergies . Prior to DMG my son was taking Zyrtec and Singulair every day and would still cough all night long if he was exposed to freshly cut grass . We started to notice after a couple of weeks on DMG that he was not as bothered by grass , and we stopped the Zyrtec because it seemed to have some bothersome side effects . My son now takes only Singulair and DMG and ( knock on wood ) is not bothered by the grass anymore . We did not assume that he no longer has allergies , but that the DMG has somehow `` helped '' his immune system enough that he no longer needs to take multiple allergy medications . Everyone 's experiences are different and what will work for one ASD child may do nothing for the next ; I am just sharing our experience .
