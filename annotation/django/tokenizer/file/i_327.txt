After a couple chelation ( IV ) trials we 've finally got our treatment underway with CAEDTA . Treatments will take place at-least every two weeks with a nurse that will come to our home . I posted the first UTM here a couple months ago . We 're happy with what 's being pulled out , but it will be several weeks before we discuss it with our DAN , so I was wondering if someone could give me their take in the mean time .
