yep , I write it down on a piece of paper and stick it on the inside of the kitchen cupboard where I keep all the supps . I have one piece that says : AM - 7 1/2 mls CLO , and 2 probiotics Midafternoon - Multi vit , Calcium , blah , blah , blah Before bed - glutathione , blah , blah , blah the second one is more like a chart along the top I have : Day , Date , probiotic , calcium , vit C , DMG , and so on with each supp name then I write in under each heading each day and date and the dose ( calcium 1/8 tsp , vit c 1/4 tsp , etc ) I am giving for each supp as sometimes they may change , and I do n't need to give everything every day , eg : Aloe Vera I only give if there are constipation issues , if there is diahrea issues I hold off on MSM , etc . I also religiously only enter the dose onto the chart as I put each supp in the mix to make sure that I do n't forget whether I have or have n't done one , I also tend to put all the bottles of supps on the counter when I start my mixture of supps , then as I add each one I record it on the chart and then put the bottle back into the cupboard ... .Luke 's afternoon supp is huge , I mix at least 7 different ones together , sometimes more , and if I do n't do it this way I get way too confused , did I just put calcium in the mix or am I just about to do it ? _________________ LindaC 9 yr old NT 6yr old ASD
