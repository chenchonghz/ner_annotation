Hi everyone, I am new to this board. I just want to wish all of you great success in finding the treatment that will help your child. There are many out there and I believe there is the right one for each child. Here are some great websites www.danconference.com and www.autismwebsite.com/ari/index.htm I have attended several of these conferences. There is hope for a cure you just need the right people to help you. Even though my son is 32 years old I still research all of the new treatments. One thing that has helped him in the past 8 months is antioxidants. As you may know they help remove the toxins out of our bodies. The one in particular that I have used is the mangosteen juice. It has calmed my son and killed bacteria that vancomycin couldn't. Check out www.thegoldenfruit.com which will give you more info about it. I hope this has helped. Keep the faith.   - Karen  Hope is the beginning of faith in whatever you are believing.
