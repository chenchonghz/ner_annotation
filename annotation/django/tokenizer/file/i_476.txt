Hello folks , I did blood and urine testing for DS for the first time . He is 5 . Majority of the the work is within normal limits but some of it a high and I need help with the interpretation . Google gives me scary results . I would like to know if there is any other parent faced similar issue and how they resolved it . It will be fairly long post , please bear with me . Eosinophils- 12 % ( 0-5 reference ) Eosinophils ( absolute ) - 0.8x10E3/ul ( reference is 0.0-0.3 ) BUN/Creatinine ratio- 30 ( 9-27 ) Alkaline Phasphatase- 339 ( 133-309 ) Urine pH is 8.0 Triglycerides- 79 ( 0-74 ) Vit . E- 21.3 ( 4.6-17.8 ) Rest of the stuff is within the reference range , but if you need any other results to interpret , let me know and will post it if its done . He is currently taking following supplements . Morning- Fish Oil 2.5ml GLA 0.5ml Super K One caplet Gamma tocopherol 300mg Alpha tocopherol 400mg Vit . C 500mg Adenosyl-B12 1500mcg Taurine 500mg Mg-Citrate 100mg Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate 50mg Folinic Acid 400mcg Citicholine 100mg Afternoon- N-Acetyl Cysteine + Se+Mb 600mg Phosphatidylserine 100mg Coenzymated B1 12.5mg Oregano Oil 1 caplet Evening Psyllium seed powder 2 tsp Activated Charcoal 1 tsp Dinner time Nexazyme 1 capsule Fish Oil 2.5ml GLA 0.5ml Alpha tocopherol 400mg Gamma tocopherol 300mg MB12 1000mcg Citicholine 100mg Bed time Zinc 25mg Melatonin 1mg It is clear that higher Vit . E levels are because of Vit E supplement that he is taking but what about others ? Any insight is appreciated . The pediatrician says , everything is OK ( ? ? ) Thanks in advance . _________________ iHerb code BMV549 $ 5/ $ 10 off on $ 20/ $ 40 first order uBiome $ 10 off http : //bit.ly/1xYWjbG
