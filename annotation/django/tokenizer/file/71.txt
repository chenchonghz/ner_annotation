I just moved from Texas. So glad!!!!! I hear the best place to be for Autism resources are in Houston and Austin. Carrollton ISD has a pretty decent public school setup and I think Plano ISD might be a applying ABA. I know the Autism Treatment Center is for inpatient children. Yes, they have very young Autistic children which are residents. Apparently parental rights were severed for what ever reasons. My son's speech therapist would go to that center from time to time to see clients. There is the North Star Academy in Grapevine - I know they have a long waiting list and our insurance would not even consider it, so I did not look into it further.
