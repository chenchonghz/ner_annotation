For us it has been Neurotransmission Dopamine/Seretonin regulators . DMAE Phosphotidylcholine L-Tyrosine Taurine Glutamine Choline ( just started , but so far so good ) Namenda ( prescription , but this has made a huge difference ) For us , this came after years of being convinced everything was yeast and food issues . I wish I would have went this route earlier . When I switched doctors , we started this profile , and it has been amazing . Of course my son did have horrible gut issues , and issues with the usual suspects , and horrible yeast problems , but the focus was all on that , and the rest was on the backburner . Now we are moving on to our next major issue , which is the strep virus , and lead . IV chelation was not good for us . It kicked up yeast so bad , that the negatives for us , far outweighed the positives . We are trying another method , which is slower , but better for us . We just started transdermal B 's from Lee Silsby , so it is too early to see on that , but I suspect we will see some gains . My son could not tolerate any oral B 's . I have heard about Bitter Orange for speech with great results . Have you tried that ? ? ? Tanya Tanya
