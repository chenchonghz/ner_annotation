This is very interesting . Phosphorus is a part of the VitaminK protocol , which I have been reading about since DD has oxalate problems . And also B problems , of course . And oxidative stress , I believe . Thanks again for the info about B 's , Jeni , I looked at that and Riboflavin matches all DD 's stuff . Is Lee Silsby the best source of phosphorus ? Are there others that are just as effective ? I just looked up the VitK protocol and she is recommending Angstrom Minerals Liquid Phosphorus or Carlson Complexed Phosphorus Tablets . _________________ Learning to jiggle when shaken .
