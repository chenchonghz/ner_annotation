Our son has low muscle tone and mito issues and we have been using the Acetyl L-Carnitine for over a year now with no known results . I am going to try switching to just L-Carnitine to see if that helps . I have heard of some kids responding better to one or the other . _________________ Lynn Mom to 7yo , Somewhere on the Spectrum
