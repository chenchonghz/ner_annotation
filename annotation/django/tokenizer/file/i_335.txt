Our son was on Dilantin and Lamictal , a combination of both and then only Lamictal . Dilantin is good to get started with but it requires frequent blood draws to maintain optimal levels . Then Lamictal was added and then the Dilantin was weaned away . Our neurologist said he likes to use meds for no longer than 2 years so he weaned our son away from the meds after 2 years and so far so good , no seizures ! ! ! _________________ Merry mom to A-14 yo boy with autism and type 1 diabetes
