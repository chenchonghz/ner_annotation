We have found that SAMe and Methionine often block the MB12 effect and in many cases cause a regression . SAMe and Methionine enter the methlation pathway at different points and often work against mb12 . Clinically most of our kids on mb12 did not do as well when adding these supplements . For those on MB12 we do not use them . For those not on mb12 we find methionine is helpful .
