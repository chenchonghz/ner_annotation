It is why we are vulnerable , we do n't know how . I certainly have not gotten much coping skills in half a century either . They need to be taught or learned uniquely for each and every situation of life . It reminds me of a time i was in high school and was skateboarding down the hall and a teacher put his hand up for me to stop yet i kept going past.When i got called into the principal 's office later that day the principal asked me why did n't i stop when the teacher told me to.I told him i had did slow down , and at he laughed and just let me go saying `` I do n't think he meant for you to put it in 1st gear . `` With my many troubles in school , i was always honest about them .
