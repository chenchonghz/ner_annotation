Here 's a link to another story about a Johns Hopkins research study into the role of fever and autism : Autism Study Lends Credence to 'Fever Effect ' http : //www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php ? storyId=16956039 Partial quote from the story ( click the link to read the whole thing ) : Quote : Dr. Andy Zimmerman of Kennedy Krieger says the answer probably involves the connections between brain cells which many researcher believe is one place things go wrong in autism . Zimmerman says that it 's not the rise in a child 's temperature that makes the difference . But it may be that brain connections work better in the presence of small proteins called cytokines that are produced by the immune system . `` We 'd like to know what those cytokines are in children with autism when they get fevers , to see if one or more of these cytokines might be unusually increased , '' he says . That might lead to a treatment that could mimic the beneficial effects of fever without actually making a child sick . _________________ The seeking is the goal and the search is the answer
