I was reading the DAN book and it said you should give about 6mg of B-6 and 4mg of Mag . for each pound the child weighs or something like that . Well , that means my 60 lb boy should get about 360mg of B-6 and 240 mg of mag a day . That seems like a lot as he is only getting 50mg of B-6 now . ( one capsule ) . I mean he gets some of each in the spectrum complete and then I also give the b-6 and mag . seperate but no where near that much . How much is everyone else giving . I want the best benefit but do n't want to endanger him . Should I be upping it ? I usually just start out small but I guess I tend to then move on to adding more without upping what he is already getting . Should I slowly up it to what the book says ? What are you doing ? thanks
