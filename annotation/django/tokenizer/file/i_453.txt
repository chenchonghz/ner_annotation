Quote : vitamin B1 Alternative name : thiamine Mechanism of Action : Thiamine pyrophosphate ( TPP ) is a coenzyme for pyruvate dehydrogenase , -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase . The first two of these enzymes function in the metabolism of carbohydrates , while transketolase functions in the pentose phosphate pathway to synthesize NADPH and the pentose sugars deoxyribose and ribose . Systemic thiamine deficiency can lead to myriad problems including neurodegeneration , wasting , and death . Well-known syndromes caused by lack of thiamine due to malnutrition or a diet high in thiaminase-rich foods include Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and beriberi , diseases also common in chronic abusers of alcohol .
