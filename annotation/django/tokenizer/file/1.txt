I never thought of that- maybe I was pretty weird as a kid! :-D But something really hit me quickly at 13. One month I was winning gymnastics meets and literally the next, disabled. Zoned right out. THe only things I can think that may have made it worse was the booster MMR shot, an amalgem filling, and STREP that hit all in one month, I don't know if there is a connection, but who knows?  But I am glad that you are working- I am in Voc Rehab and I am hoping that I will be able to work, too.  Are you in treatment or have you just accepted who you are?
