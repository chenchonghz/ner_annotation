I want to say by the way that neuroleptics are not like `` all meds '' having side-effects , they 're a pretty scary kind of med that really is dangerous in ways that most meds aren't.Not that scary does n't have its place ever . I 'm on Prednisone right now , which is utterly terrifying in terms of side-effects but life-saving for severe asthma and some other conditions . But I would n't ever say that Prednisone is the same as `` all drugs having side-effects '' , nor would I ever say that about neuroleptics . Prednisone and neuroleptics are both seriously heavy-duty drugs and not at all in the same league as most others.And I seriously do n't think that I would give my kid Prednisone ( if I had a kid ) to make them able to stay in school . It 'd have to be something life-threatening . Similarly I would n't give a kid a neuroleptic unless it was dangerous levels of vomiting or something and then I 'd have them watched like a hawk for side-effects and only give it for the minimum time possible . I 'd rather have a kid outside school than in school and on these things to make them capable of being in an environment they clearly were n't suited to . Edited by gtto on May 20 2007 at 6:16pm
