Thought I would post this regarding manganese and hyperactive ( and oppositional ) behaviors . I do n't know what implications this may have in regard to magnesium supplementation , but you will find the full text ( and a discussion of the limitations of the study ) on the following site ( you have to join , but it is free ) : http : //www.medscape.com/viewarticle/553131_1 Quote : Hair Manganese and Hyperactive Behaviors : Pilot Study of School-Age Children Exposed through Tap Water Posted 03/16/2007 Maryse Bouchard ; Francois Laforest ; Louise Vandelac ; David Bellinger ; Donna Mergler Abstract Background : Neurotoxic effects are known to occur with inhalation of manganese particulates , but very few data are available on exposure to Mn in water . We undertook a pilot study in a community in Quebec ( Canada ) where naturally occurring high Mn levels were present in the public water system . Our objective was to test the hypothesis that greater exposure to Mn via drinking water would be reflected in higher Mn content in hair which , in turn , would be associated with increased level of hyperactive behaviors . Methods : Forty-six children participated in the study , 24 boys and 22 girls , 6-15 years of age ( median , 11 years ) . Their homes received water from one of two wells ( W ) with different Mn concentrations : W1 : mean 610 g/L ; W2 : mean 160 g/L . The Revised Conners ' Rating Scale for parents ( CPRS-R ) and for teachers ( CTRS-R ) were administered , providing T-scores on the following subscales : Oppositional , Hyperactivity , Cognitive Problems/Inattention , and ADHD Index . Results : Children whose houses were supplied by W1 had higher hair Mn ( MnH ) than those supplied by W2 ( mean 6.2 4.7 g/g vs. 3.3 3.0 g/g , p = 0.025 ) . MnH was significantly associated with T-scores on the CTRS-R Oppositional ( p = 0.020 ) and Hyperactivity ( p = 0.002 ) subscales , after adjustment for age , sex , and income . All children with Oppositional and Hyperactivity T-scores 65 had MnH 3.0 g/g . Conclusions : The findings of this pilot study are sufficiently compelling to warrant more extensive investigations into the risks of Mn exposure in drinking water . _________________ Winnie Make it a powerful memory , the happiest you can remember .
