Quote : is there anyone else on this plateau ? for how long has it been since you have seen improvements and positive changes in your child ? My son is 11 . I would have to say that his biggest gains were in the last 3 years , after a long `` plateau '' . He initially had big gains on chelation and MB-12 shots ( age 5 and 6 ) , then pretty much maintained without gains for a couple of years . Then he started on LDN . That was a big one for him . His cognitive gains were impressive , and his socialization also improved . LDN regulates the immune system , as well as provide a boost in endorphins . After seeing such gains I got more aggressive with his treatment . Tried HBOT , oxytocin , DMPS suppositories , Liverlife , increased or added a bunch of supplements , etc . A few months ago I went to a new DAN doctor , to get a fresh perspective . He had new ideas , had me look into issues like oxidative stress , inflammation , etc . Just simple things like increasing 5-HTP from 50 mg to 300 mg helped calm my son enormously . We also jacked up his CoQ10 ( to 200 mg per day , to help oxidative stress ) , and started him on spironolactone ( anti-inflammatory ) . The last one just a few days ago , I 'm not sure about the effect yet . But I can tell you that my son now is in mainstream 6th grade , with no support , and doing spectacularly well ( his interim report today had 5 A 's and 1 B ) . He also plays baseball , goes to Boy Scouts , and I can see a day in his future when he will be indistinguishable from his peers ( right now he still speaks hesitantly and with some grammatical errors , and it is difficult for him to maintain social interaction for more than 15-20 minutes ... . except when playing Playstation ! ! ! ! ) . I certainly agree with Tami and others that perhaps it is time to consider a new protocol or approach . I can tell you from my experience that your son is definitely not too old to improve . Best of luck ! _________________ Laura , Ian 's mom
