hi jen , my son for the past months has these emotional ups downs . we are not using 5htp but l theanine with gaba has relly helped . 100 mg of l theanine 250 mg of kirkman gaba , you can even give less gaba if you want . i think that l theanine has really helped.they are not gone but reduced by 80 % , which is HUGE for us coz he was having melt downs with the drop of a hat . HTH aisha
