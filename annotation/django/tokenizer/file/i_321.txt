Hello , It been a while since I posted and Gregory was actually doing pretty well . He is on prescription meds and some natural ones and right now we are weaning him off of prescription one at a time . We just finished weaning him off of Paxil and are having problems now so I am not sure what to do because I am not going to put him back on that . Right now I am giving him 1mg of 2 stage release melotonin in the morning which slows him down enough so he can focus and be sort of still . I also give him 50mg of 5-htp in the morning and 50mg at night with another 1mg melatonin . The issues we are having now are he is so extremely emotional and will have an all out meltdown at the smallest things . His OCD is also much worse wich causes meltdowns because something is not the way he thinks it should be . I thought the 5-htp would help with this but I have not seen much of a difference and it has been almost 4 weeks since we started it . He is also not sleeping very well again either , he is very restless and up between 4 and 5 every morning . Are there any other recommendation that I could try . I have tried Magnesium , DMAE , PS , Tyrosine , L-theanin in the past and they did not seem to have any effect on him either . Thanks . Teri
