She started the carnitine 3 months ago . We noticed immediately that she was more alert . If a child is carnitine deficient , basically they do not have enough energy to focus or learn , that is what causes the delays in language devleopment and learning . Correcting a carnitine deficiency improves the child 's ability to learn , but does not take away the delays , that is why therapies : speech , physical , OT , ABA , going to preschool with typical children is still an integral part of helping her catch up . I have heard it can take up to 6 months to get to normal muscle tone and levels . For those who do n't know l-carnitine is just an amino acid normally made in the body from lysine or taken in directly through consumption of mostly meats . It 's available over the counter or by prescription . It is believed that the prescription is more potent because of regulations insuring it 's purity . I would n't suggest using it unless you have been checked and do have a carnitine deficiency . Carnitine levels are different in urine , blood and muscle . You can be deficient in plasma and still show normal urine levels . You can be deficient in muscle and still have normal plasma levels . Carnitine deficiencies can be secondary to fatty acid oxidation disorders you can go to fodsupport.org to learn more about them . They are very difficult to diagnose . _________________ Daughter 5 , atypical autism
