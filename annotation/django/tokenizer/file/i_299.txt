Aluminium comes first , lead 15th and mercury 10th . though there was no mercury in the MMR ? what is lead doing in it ? ? This does NOT show the organic material in the shots like monkey brains , caterpillars and aborted feotus , only minerals and heavy metals , but rest assured those horrid products are there . Got this done at a well respected lab . I suggest you ask your doctor for an `` extra '' mmr shot to get it analysed . Yeah , right ! First off he or she wont give you one , cause of `` safety '' issues , also cause you know they are SO EXPENSIVE and 3rdly , wont give you one , cause this is just the kind of thing they worry we will do with it .
