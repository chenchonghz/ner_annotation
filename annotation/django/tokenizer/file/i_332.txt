Hi Kelly , This summer we purchased the trial sizes of Brainchild 's Spectrum II P5P which is the most common from what I 've seen out of Brainchild vit/min . Bobby is not seeing a DAN ! doctor but he is on the GFCF diet with huge success . The P5P formula really distrupted his sleep so we ordered the trial of the PAK formula which is the same but a slightly different B in there , or is resource is different from what I understand . This too disrupted his sleep . Every time I went back to his regular heart shaped `` Love Bites '' ( http : //www.betterlife.com/prod_home_pag ... od_id=1975 ) he slept fine and every time we tried the next trial of Brainchild vit/min he was fine until we got closer to the full dose . I did talk to a Brainchild rep and understand that they can react to the high levels of B this way and our only option at this point is to back off or go to the sensitive formula . We stopped using the spectrum for now and we are working on enzymes . From what I 've read about enzymes , if you can get their own bodies to absorb better ( which the enzymes do for them ) , you may not need the mega doses of vit/min since their bodies can now more properly absorb them . I 'm willing to give it a try because I know it 's not dangerous . The mega doses of vit/min really made me a bit nervous as well . As far as kirkman brand . I heard in more than one resource that some children get sick on the vitamins or have upset stomachs . Also , I found that some of Kirkman 's products ( Kirkman Super Nuthera P5P powder form ) have sucralose in them which bothers me and may be an issue for children on the SCD diet . Below are the sites for the two most popular and safe brands : http : //www.brainchildnutritionals.com/B ... d_Nux.html http : //www.kirkmanlabs.com/ audrey
