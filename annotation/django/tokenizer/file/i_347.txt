This is an old post I thought I would bring up again as it ties up a few things swirling about in my head : 1 . Celery is good for brain inflammation - celery contains luteolin . So does basil ( Holy Basil ) used for brain inflammation . 2 . Neuroprotek/Lutimax also contain luteolin and rutin . 3 . Luteolin brings down inflammatory cytokines triggered by LPS , contained in many vaccines . http : //www.microbialinfluence.com/ASD.html
