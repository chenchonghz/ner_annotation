HI I have just started using TTFD and L-glutathione . The TTFD was used first for two weeks and then I started the L-glutathione . My son is now very yeasty . Do not know whether to stop it or continue with the hope that the TTFd and glutathione will adjust and the yeast slow down a bit . Hope this makes sense . I am using varioud yeast killers . Any advice ? My son also was very itchy last night . This was where I put the cream . Has anyone had good things with the creams as they are very expensive and at the moment was happy the way he was before ! Emma
