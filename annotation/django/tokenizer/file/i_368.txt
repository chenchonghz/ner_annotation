at least for a while ... doc put her on Betaine for stomach stuff ... and I know the two do n't mix . I want to try the betaine..she has been on the shots for 3 1/2 years ( ! ) . What do you think ? Would you stop the shots if your child reacted to betaine and MB12 in the past ? Stop the shots for a time ( not sure how long ) to use the betaine instead ? _________________ ~Blessed to be called Mama by many~
