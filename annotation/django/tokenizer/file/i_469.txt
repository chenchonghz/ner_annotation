Why the chlorine dioxide does not harm the body Chlorine dioxide has the weakest oxidation potential ( .95 volts ) of all the oxidizers . Oxygen has the next highest oxidation potentials of 1.28 volts . Those oxidation potentials of .95 and 1.28 volts can do very little damage to the human body . This is because these voltages can not overcome the opposing oxidation potentials in the human cells and tissues . And as you can see , if oxygen does very little or no damage , then the lesser oxidation voltage of chlorine dioxide is not likely to do any damage at all . [ 9 ] Chlorine Dioxide is highly selective and does not harm stomach and intestine useful microorganisms : Chlorine dioxide is highly selective for pathogens that cause diseases in the body , and does not kill the various useful flora of the stomach and intestines . This is due to the unique properties of the chlorine dioxide molecule . More info at : http : //mmswiki.org/index.php ? title=Basic_Science_of_MMS
