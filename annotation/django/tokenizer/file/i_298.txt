Folks , I 'm curoius on feedback from the board on side effects of anti-yeast treatment ... this issue of `` die-off '' . Our DAN doctor warned us regarding die-off and possible regression we would see . We 've been on this for 5-6 weeks now . Well , I did not see immediate side effects from Ketoconazale and other anti-yeast supplement . Rather it took around 2-3 weeks before we possibly started seeing issues . It 's been hard to read , but my son has been more agitated the past 2 weeks ( which also corresponds to a cold he had ) . We are seeing problems ( agitation , volatility , stimming ) . We 've had a few months of smooth sailing on MB-12 shots ( we 're about 6 monhs in now ) , so we were a bit `` spoiled , '' I think ... . Regarding `` die-off , '' which we 're thinking this may be ... a ) is it commong to start a few weeks in ... or is usually right at the beginning of a treatment than includes an antifungal ? Is it normal to see this delay in possible problem behavoir ? Fyi , I 've been giving the dude activated charcoal during the worst days of this , but I do n't think it did much ... b ) how long does `` die-off last '' ... .. Like MB-12 shots , I 'm game to ride this `` out '' , if this is the issue ... since the road is brighter ahead if we can get through this . But how long can this last ? c ) If we 're not SCD ... is it still possible to effectively deal with Yeast ( with this anti-yeast regimen ) ? Thank you , Adam
