I found this on Cure Autism Now 's website : CAN Treatment Advisory Board member , Evdokia Anagnostou , M.D. , from Mount Sinai School of Medicine ended the psychcopharmacology symposium with an overview of the available pharmaceutical treatments for autism . Much of Dr. Anagnostous talk centered on the drug memantine which is commercially known as Namenda and currently used as a treatment for Alzheimers disease . Memantine acts to partially block a particular type of nerve cell receptor when they are over stimulated by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate . Too many excitatory signals can be harmful to nerve cells and may result in excitotoxicity , which can lead to nerve cell dath . While there is a clear role for excitotoxicity in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease , it is unclear whether or not excitotoxicity is involved in the pathogenesis of autism . Yet , Dr. Anagnostou described reports of improved compliance behaviors in children who have tried memantine although the efficacy of memantine for ameliorating symptoms of autism has not yet been studied in a controlled clinical trial . Fortunately , several clinical trials studying different features of memantine action on autism are slated to begin this year , including a multi-site trial sponsored by CAN in which the effects of memantine on motor planning and expressive language will be specifically examined by investigators participating in CANs new autism Clinical Trials Network .
