A few weeks ago I bought from Amazon this Manuka Honey : Wedderspoon Raw Organic Organic Manuka Honey Active 16+ , 17.6-Ounce Jar Price was 25 USD , free shipping Link : http : //www.amazon.com/Wedderspoon-Organ ... B000VK08OC The package arrived from Amazon nicely and intact . ( I mention this because some reviewers on Amazon complained that the plastic jar broke in transit. ) The honey itself is brown and relatively very liquid , almost like the bear-shaped yellow honey in the supermarket . In my mouth , this Manuka Honey tasted 90 % like regular honey , with a slight after-taste . Unfortunately , my child ( age 3.5 ) , a picky eater who Loves regular honey , thought differently , and refuses to eat the Manuka Honey . I fooled him several times to take a spoon of Manuka Honey , but he disliked it , almost gagged on it once . The Manuka Honey is with us for a month now , and remained it its liquid form . I am not sorry that I ordered the Manuka Honey : this was my original intent two months ago to spend around 25 bucks and see if my child can take it or not .
