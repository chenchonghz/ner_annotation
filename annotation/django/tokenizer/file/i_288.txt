Wow , I will be aghast if NCD heals his warts . ./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif Dana , can we do NDF plus and NCD zeolite at the same time ? How would that work ? We 're up to about 10 drops daily of NCD right now , but I 'm sure we 'll run out at some point and have to reorder . ( we are also sitll doing MB12 shots , so that might also be a lot of the reason for his progress as well. ) . _________________ Joey , 10 yrs. , PDD-NOS was our last dx GFCF , Yasko , ABA Hoping to get to RDI
