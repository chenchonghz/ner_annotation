please reconsider this form of treatment look for hard evidence from reknown medical studies/ professionals / universities. i know that my son's dev ped and i had a good laugh over the thought that swimming with dolphins could perhaps "cure " anything, other than perhaps one's fear of dolphins. now,we do sacral cranial manipulation and we do use it with my son, along with reflexology, and and massage therapy. we don't use it to "cure " anything we use it to desensitize his tactile dysfunction. i implore you to talk to your child's doctor, a licensed ped, a dev ped, or a nuero psych, they will be able to tell you about the available and tested forms of therapies that may benefit you child. if something something sounds to good to be true, it's usually is.
