There is new strong evidence of a link between prenatal use of acetaminophen and autism . A very well done , prospective cohort study found that prolonged prenatal use of acetaminophen was linked to severe adverse developmental outcomes in 3 year olds . These outcomes are all typical autism phenotypes . The researchers also looked at ibuprofen and did not find any of these adverse effects . This study did not look at acetaminophen use by the infants . Caution and more research is warranted . http : //sciencenordic.com/prenatal-use-p ... 9-problems http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24163279
