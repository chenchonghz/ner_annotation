Hello all , Well I just wrote this morning on the enhansa thread on how well my son has been doing on the enhansa and everything else . Of course the school nurse calls this morning and Mick has a weird rash all over his body . Not the normal rash I am used to everytime he has die off . This is bloachy ( sp ? ? ./images/smilies/icon_redface.gif ) red spots all over his neck , face , arms , hands , back and some even on his legs . It is absolutely HORRIBLE . He is also very itchy and very uncomfortable . The doctor for all the schools was there and he checked him out . He believed Mick might be having an allergic reaction to the Flagyl . He is on day 9 of it and only had 1 more day to go . Okay his DAN doc just called back and said it is probable just a allergic reaction to the Flagyl and since he was almost done with it and it probably did what it needed to do , to stop it . I was told to give him a warm bath with oatmeal ( for the itching ) and to give benedryl and that should help . It always seems like 2 steps forward and 4 back ! ! ! ! ./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif Poor kid , he looks horrible right now . What our kids go through day in and day out - this truly sucks ! ! ! ! ! _________________ Kristen Matt Samantha 7 McKinley 6 Dyspraxia , ADD/ADHD , recovered ASD Riley 2 Cadighan 1
