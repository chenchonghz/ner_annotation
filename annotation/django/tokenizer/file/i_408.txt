All , I know I have a viral kid ( eye stims , never falls sick , etc . ) and whatever we 've done for him till now , is not helping him communicate . He has been talking for a while now but he is not communicating . I 'm hoping anti-viral will make him much better since he is a viral kid and I really need your help in this . We ran the viral panel for my son and he tested very high for measles anti-bodies . However , he did not show problems with any of the other viruses in the panel . However , I would still like to do a Valtrex trial . Here 's what I plan . Please give me your suggestions or help me improve the approach . 1 . His Vit.D is low . Once that comes within range , I plan to do the high dose Vitamin A protocol . As far as the high dose vitamin A therapy is concerned , I 've read posts where parents have given 4,00,000 I.U./day for 2 days and then continued at 25,000 I.U . for several months . Do you know how long at the most we can continue 25,000 I.U . without building vitamin A toxicity . 2 . Start with Valtrex ( run at least a 50 day trial ) . 3 . After 50 days of Valtrex , add natural anti-virals like Monolaurin , OLE , LDM , etc . Please give any suggestions that will help target the measles . Is it ok to add the natural anti-virals later or would you recommend adding that within the 50 day Valtrex trial i.e . give Valtrex foe 5 days in a week and give natural anti-virals in the other 2 days ? Thanks in advance . Best regards , Arpita .
