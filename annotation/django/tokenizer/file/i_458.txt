My child has the two COMT++ SNPs as well as a VDR++ and a CBS +- Everywhere I look , it says the COMT++ are the hard ones . I experiment on myself first , because his panel is like mine , in many ways . We both also have one MTHFr +- ( the CD one , not the A one ) I have been using tiny bits of methyfolate because we hafve to stay away from too much . I have also been using methionine and NAC , but will switch directly to the glutathione . Plan is : HydroxyB12 methylfolate niacin when over methylated yucca on accasion betain If anyone has COMT++ plus all these other issues , I would love to know what you have done . Trust me , we have had a terrible time of it . Now that we know this , it 's been the first sliver of hope , but overmethylation ... ... it is as hard to handle as under . okradlakpok , I was curious as to your results with these supplements . Have you experienced any overmethylation with methylfolate , methionine ? If so , what was that like ? From what I have heard people who are homozygous for comt have the potential for moodswings/ mania with too many methyl groups , which is why you 're probably trying to avoid them . I was just wondering if that ever happened . Also , why did you decide to switch from NAC and go straight to glutathione ? I am curious to know your reasoning . Also , have you noticed any really significant results with your supplement regime ? I am really curious about the hydroxy b-12 and the niacin in particular .
