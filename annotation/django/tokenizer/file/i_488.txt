Food and Drug Administration U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service 5600 Fishers Lane Rockville , MD 20857 T98-48 Print Media : 301-827-6242 August 31 , 1998 Consumer Inquiries : 800-532-4440 IMPURITIES CONFIRMED IN DIETARY SUPPLEMENT 5-HYDROXY-L-TRYPTOPHAN FDA scientists have confirmed the presence of impurities in some 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan ( 5HTP ) products currently marketed and widely promoted as dietary supplements . These products are being used as aids for insomnia , depression , obesity , and in children with attention deficit disorder . FDA 's analytical results are consistent with those obtained and published by researchers from the Mayo Clinic . One of these impurities is known as `` peak X . '' Although the significance of finding `` peak X '' and other impurities in dietary supplements containing 5-HTP is unknown , past experiences with these products suggests vigilance is warranted . `` Peak X '' was identified in one case of the illness eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome ( EMS ) associated with 5HTP in 1991 . Impurities similar to `` peak X '' were also found in L-tryptophan that was associated with a 1989 epidemic of EMS . 5HTP and L-tryptophan are related in that 5HTP is synthesized from L-Tryphophan in the body . The exact cause of the 1989 epidemic and of the case of EMS associated with 5HTP remain unclear . EMS is a serious systemic illness characterized by elevations of certain white blood cells and severe muscle pain . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has identified more than 1,500 cases of EMS , including at least 38 deaths associated with the use of L-tryptophan . The medical literature reports approximately 10 previous cases of EMS worldwide associated with use of products containing 5HTP . Research has not resolved whether these EMS were caused by L-tryptophan or 5HTP , one or more impurities , or other factors . At this time , FDA is unaware of any recent illnesses associated with the 5HTP products being sold as dietary supplements . The widespread promotion and use of these products , however , began only recently . FDA is working closely with its colleagues at CDC and NIH to monitor the situation and is consulting with other professionals and patient groups . To assist in its monitoring efforts , FDA encourages consumers to contact FDA 's MedWatch program by calling 1-800-FDA-1088 to obtain information about how to report serious adverse events . Physicians and other health care practitioners are encouraged to report such adverse events to FDA 's MedWatch program by phone ( 1-800-FDA-1088 ) , fax ( 1-800-FDA-0178 ) or mail ( using postage-paid form ) to FDA , HF-2 , 5600 Fishers Lane , Rockville , MD 20852-9787 .
