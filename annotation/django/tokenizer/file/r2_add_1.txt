Hi there ! Do you have a regular physician that you go to for checkups or when you are sick ? I would express your concerns to that person and ask for a referred to a neuropsychiatrist . If you post what state / county you live in , perhaps someone here could give you a recommendation for a good neuropsych to talk to . I live in the Chicago area and I have folks I could recommend if you so happened to live around here . The great thing about going to a neuropsych is that they can not only give you a dx ( which would be done after talking to you , having you fill out some questionnaires and maybe taking a few tests ) but that person can also help you with some strategies to deal with the situations that you find difficult such as dating or the workplace . Best of luck to you and welcome to the forum ! - Kristy Mom to 10 year old twin boys ( 1 PDD-NOS , 1 ADHD )
