No, I'm sorry Diane, NCD is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of anything. It is supplement - not a drug.  dgdavis64 wrote:     DMSA is approved for chelation of lead and since my son has lead in the red, I guess that means autism IS included.       I'm afraid that FDA approval does not use your extrapolation - DMSA is not approved for treatment of autism.  dgdavis64 wrote:     Unfortunately, many parents have been lead to believe that chelation is DEADLY.        I have not indicated that chelation is deadly - just that it does carry risks and should be done under medical supervision. No one knows the effects of using these substances for prolonged periods of time (years for some children). - Heffalump
