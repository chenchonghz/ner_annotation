We were supplementing with B complex along with other vitamins and minerals for some time and especially since we started chelating . Then we read about the Pfeiffer protocol . Now we 're confused ! It seems our daughter is an under methylator so Pfeiffer recommends avoiding folic acid as well as choline and manganese . Is supplementing with B-complex while doing Cutler absolutely necessary ? Will we be doing any harm if we temporarily hold off on the B-vitamins to see if her stimming and hyperactivity decreases ? We 're giving ASD ( no B 's ) vitamins right now . We could n't find a B-complex that did n't have folic acid which is why we stopped the B-complex altogether . We are giving B6 as per the Pfeiffer protocol . Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated . We are on round 11 of chelation at this time . Thank you . _________________ Mom to Alanna , Julia and Sophia Julia diagnosed with PDD-NOS March 2007
