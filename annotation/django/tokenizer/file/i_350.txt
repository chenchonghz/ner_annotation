So , I have decided to go natural after 3 months of Valtrex . We are unsure if her high liver enzymes are due to poor lab technique , her age of 3 where there is a lot of growth , or due to Valtrex ( we have no baseline ) . I have read terrible reports of parents going off it at 2 or 3 months with regression so I am scared this is the wrong decision , but I also need to look out for her liver ! I have started her on natural anti-virals in the hope that will continue to help and if she regresses , maybe try Acyclovir since that does not harm the liver . We are going to do 30 drops of OLE with 1 Virastop and 1 Candidaise 3 times a day . I will eventually increase to 3 Virastops 3 times a day . Her labs ( after 2 1/2 months on Valtrex ) also showed she had no high titers to any of the Herpes viruses although I think her numbers did indicate she had past exposure to EBV , but not sure since I have no DAN ( they were under 100 but were 18 ( IgM , 24,19 , and 14 all IgG ) Has anyone had a similar experience where you went of the Rx and tried the naturals ? Or went off Valtrex and had regression , or went of Valtrex and tried Acyclovir if a regression happened . Also , what are other kids who are around the age of 3 liver enzymes showing ? My child 's were 243 ( ref of 0-136 ) but the PED said that could be due to growth or Valtrex and was unsure . Thanks for helping me out ! Chris
