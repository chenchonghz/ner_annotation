To all parents who have used manuka honey before , We started to feed our son manuka honey last Friday , only a baby teaspoon each feeding . In the last 3 days , we saw hyper + spinning from morning to evening . Strong feeding resistance + vomiting everyday . I suspect manuka honey feeds yeast in my son 's case . But I also strongly suspect my son has been suffering from peptic ulcer , for he has been displaying all sorts of symptoms related to ulcer , such as repetitive vomiting , reflux + bad heartburn , and claptoage . Manuka honey is supposed to be a good treatment for ulcer . On the other hand , if it is yeasty , we have to stop it . Meanwhile , we used orange peel oil to treat reflux and heartburn . It 's supposed to be the top 1 weapon for heartburn release . Unfortunately , it seems to stimulate ulcer in my son 's case . So , we are deep in a dilemma . Any suggestions ? Thanks much in advance .
