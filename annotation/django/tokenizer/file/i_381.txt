Why Manuka honey ? My son has been getting raw honey in his milk for several months . What is the difference between Manuka and regular raw honey ? I had already read raw honey was suspose to have antimicrobial benefits . Just curious . Wondering if this was a sales pitch to sell Manuka honey and if any raw honey could have the benefits .
