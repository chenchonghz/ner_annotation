Hi, my son is 2.5 yrs his eye contact is poor, he can only say a few words and only uses the word "dummy" every day. His motor skills are fine. His social skills poor and he shows no motivation to mix with other children. However he loves to play with his toys. I have started him with some omega 3. I am considering changing his diet maybe get rid of mild and wheat. I m interested in chelation have read alot of positive stuff about it but would like to hear from anyone who has actually tryed it on their child. Another interesting issue is that about 8 years ago when I had the hep B injection the next day I could not talk. did not think anything of it at the time other than it was a severe migrane. How I wish I never had my son vaccinated looking at the evidence that it causes autism now. I m from the UK does anyone know of any chelation specialists or good therapists here? thanks for reading  dave- Dava
