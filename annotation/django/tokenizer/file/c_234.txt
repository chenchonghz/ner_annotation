sorry.. I forgot my message.. I was wonderig the same thing . Paxil made my son NUTS.. we now have him on adderall xl.. and risperdal .25.. he should take it 2x a day but I only give it once and it 's been great ... first we did the concerta/risperdal ... but after a couple of years of that it did n't work as it should.. then we found we needed to add wellbutrin xl.. we only do the adderall as a convenience because my other son takes it for his ADD ... easier on the pocketbook a bit.. talk to your dr about trying a different med with the risperdal.. the paxil made Chad very uncaring.. for instance he slammed a kids head into a wall and was like.. oh well.. it will behave almost the same way on the kids as it will on a person with anxiety.. they dont care..
