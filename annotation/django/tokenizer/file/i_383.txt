HMMMMM ... .very interesting ! ! You know I have been using sea salt as well for quite some time ! ! Today the kids are complaining of being weak , tired , and down right cranky I might add . It has been going on for about a week now , but I had only thought of mold allergies being the culprit ( allergies are the big picture ) as to their negative behaviors . I think you are on to something ! ! Maybe this is our problem as well as allergies . I know if you do n't have enough iodine it can cause all kind of problems ! ! What brand of sea salt would have enough iodine in it ? I 'm too scared to supplement iodine with my kids because I do n't want to over do it . I have taken plain kelp in capsules before with good results , but have forgotten over the last few months . Thanks for this epiphany . I know looking into this for me and my family . Is n't this a great forum ? ? God Bless , Misty _________________ God will never give you more than you can handle at a given time . http : //chicksrus.blogspot.com/
