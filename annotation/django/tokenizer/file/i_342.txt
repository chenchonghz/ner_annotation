Summer , It looks like both the Kirkman brand the Now brand `` Calicium Ascorbate '' both are a ascorbate buffered vitamin C. The only difference I see is that the Now brand uses calicium to get the ascorbate Kirkman uses sodium , potassium magnesium to get the ascorbate . Both have Ascorbic Acid , that is what vitamin C is . They use ascorbate from different sources to buffer the ascorbic acid . Now which ascorbate acid is better `` from calcium or from sodium , potassium magnesium '' I have no idea . Here is a little discription from both brands . From Now brand `` Calcium Ascorbate '' : Quote : Calcium Ascorbate is an optimal nutritional supplement that combines Ascorbic Acid ( Vitamin C ) with Calcium Carbonate . By combining these two dietary ingredients , we have created a buffered source of Vitamin C that will not contribute to gastric irritation is sensitive persons . From Kirkman brand `` Buffered Vitamin C '' : Quote : Our Buffered Vitamin C is formulated with sodium , potassium and magnesium ascorbates to produce a buffered , acid balanced product which is very gentle on the stomach because the normal high acidity of ascorbic acid is counteracted by the ascorbates . If both forms of ascorbate are just as good I feel bad that you tossed the Kirkman brand away . I know how exspensive buying all these supps can be . ./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif I just wanted to mention to marylanddad that the Kirkman brand is buffered and does n't have any calcium in it since he said that his son does n't tolerate calcium .
