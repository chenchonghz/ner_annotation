[ quote= kulkulkan ] Other types of autism that can be reversed if detected in time are biotindaise deficiency , cerebral folate deficiency , and maybe even thiamine deficiency . [ quote ] Kulkulkan , do you know if there are tests for any of these deficiencies ? Too late now to catch it early enough as Conor is 5-1/2 , but I briefly read the biotindaise deficiency , and Conor had many of those symptoms . Regarding cerebral folate deficiency , I think that one only lab that was doing the testing is not doing it anymore , but Conor takes L5MTF ( which I believe is the treatment ) anyway for his C677 homozygous mutation . Thiamine deficiency ? Just a simple B1 test ?
