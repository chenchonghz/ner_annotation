My son was on namenda for 6 weeks . He started at 3mg when we went up to the 6mg dose that was suggested he had a hard time . we lowered it back to 3mg . He was on this for most of the time . He had meltdowns at school and was not himself . He exhibited an increase in anxiety , etc . with no major wows or positives . The first week or so he had seemed to be benefiting from the drug but looking back i think it was the antibiotic he was finishing up for strep . When we took him off the namenda he immediately stopped with the meltdowns and was happier . I have heard some children react this way . Supposedly it means they did not have high levels of glutamate to begin with and then the drug lowers glutamate levels even more causing a negative reaction . Im glad we tried it b/c i was curious but unfortunately it was n't appropriate for my son .
