I 'm cross-posting this from another thread : fardowza wrote : http : //toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/91/2/476 I looked over this article and do n't think it should immediately cause panic . The latter parts of the discussion section attempt to give the study more relevance by really stretching some clinical data . In the Taiwanese clinical trial cited , the maximum serum concentration of curcumin was 1.77 micromolar ( about 0.65 ug/mL ) and that 's at a dosing level of 8 grams per day ( I do n't think anyone is using that much Enhansa ) . In the cited UK trial , the maximum dose was 3.6 g/day and the peak curcumin serum levels were substantially lower . The lowest concentration of curcumin used in this study was 2.5 ug/mL ( compare that to the `` extreme '' case of 0.65 ug/mL above ) , which is quite a bit higher than you 'd expect to see using typical Enhansa doses ( though the manufacturer does claim that their mix of curcumins is better absorbed than others ) . The authors acknowledge that at this level , there is no danger of DNA damage . So long story short , do n't freak out without seeing a ton more data on the subject .
