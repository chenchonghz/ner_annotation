I have a severe case of candida and part of treating it is to rebuild the beneficial gut flora . VSL3 seems to be a great probiotic but I know it contains trace amounts of dairy . I 'm worried about taking it because I 'm sensitive/allergic to literally almost everything since starting the candida diet and antifungals 2.5 months ago . I 'm allergic to everything except chicken , turkey , and a few vegetables . For instance the other day I tried ghee butter which is tested at 99.9 % casein/lactose free and I had a minor reaction to it . I 'm aware that if I do get VSL3 I should go with the capsules because the packets actually contain a form of sugar . EDIT : I 've been taking a probiotic called Threelac for a couple months now and just looked on the box and it says it contains 30 PPM casein , or 0.00003 % . Would it be correct to assume VSL3 has a similar casein content ?
