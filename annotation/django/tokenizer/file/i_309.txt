I read it on her Blog . She says : Many people with autism have excess glutamate and low glutamine or they may have low levels of each . Glutamine counter-balances glutamate and reduces excess ammonia which harms the brain . Glutamine has nothing to do with gluten and contains no gluten . I have been on 2000mg L-Glutamine for over 15 years , longer than anyone else with autism who I know has used it . ********************************************************* I have n't tried it yet , but I 'm going to test for it with our local hospital .
