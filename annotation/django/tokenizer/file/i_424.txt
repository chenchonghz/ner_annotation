I 'm right after an hour-long talk with my DAN ! doctor . She consulted with a biochemist who had some ideas how to help my child after analysing all her results ( especially OAT ) : 1 . Treating Clostridia - we should switch our pro-biotics ( especially because we are giving her the same pro-biotics for 3 months with no rotation ) , preferably for Culturelle + S. Boulardii ( I read that VSL3 would also be helpful ) and give her Flagyl ( 3 x 125 mg a day ) 2 . AC Chelation asap - many different results indicate that heavy metals toxicity may be the main problem , especially lead 3 . Reducing excitotoxicity : - 5HTP 3x a day ( starting with 25mg and dividing it to three doses and increasing a dose ) . As serotonine precursor this will probably help to push tryptophan more into serotonin pathway , less into kynurenic pathway - niacin but in the form of Inositol Hexanicotinate ( we were giving her Nicotinamidum ) 100g 3 x a day - a loooooot of antioxidants What was interesting - the biochemist said that Clostridia toxins prevent dopamine from transforming to norephedryne ( if I got it right ) and it results in dopamine accumulation in the brain and overstimulation of neurons . I 've just started to read about this process . And we should not give her vitamin B6 . It will transform 5HTP to serotonin in her body and not in her brain and 5HTP wo n't even make it to the brain . This is our protocol for next two months and then we should repeat OAT . I hope I will see some significant changes soon . Any comments would be helpful . Thank you for your help and support so far . PS One more thing . The biochemist sais that homovanilin ( HVA ) to vanillylmandelic ( VMA ) ratio should be 1:1 . Inga has 5,5 of HVA and 3,6 of VMA , so the ratio is not correct - although both of the indicators are within ref . range . Clostridia has some connection here . I do n't know anything more about it and will explore this subject further .
