Are you sure that Pantogam is the one to blame for hyperactivity ? It is very mild preparation , maybe you 've stopped giving something else ... ? Sorry for guessing , it seems to me that you 've mentioned ones that GABA preparations are not good choice for your son ... I 've been giving my 10 years old daughter Pantogam for almost 2 months , now in higher dose ( 2x500m ) , with Carnosine extra and I am satisfied , she is much calmer now , with less fears . Thinking to give her Encephabol after month brake period , but I am afraid of it`s adverse effects ( hyperactivity , headache ) . Maybe instead that I give her Celebrice , if I find out what is it realy ( heard some good stuff from other parents ... ) , Than Pantogam again . Has anyone some knowledge about Celebrice ?
