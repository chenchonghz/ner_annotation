Our had ordered the initial testing prior to doing chelation, then just after the 1st round, then, we are to do chelation rounds every other weekend- max 2 a month- and return to the dr in approx 3 months- prior to that repeat the testing to make sure we are not chelating to fast or slow. We take 100mg of DMSA every four hours, with 32 oz of liquid during that time at least, for three days- if testing, catch urine on day four. The dr doesn't have us change the yeast protocol for chelation, just continue with the normal counter full of supplements:) For yeast, I think we are taking theraboitic detox. We were on three lac, and dr didn't like that one, but his numbers did improve. This dan dr seems to really stay away from prescriptions to some degree it seems. Isn't nystatin a prescription? Of course we just started the chelation process over the last several months. It took so long to get his nutritional status in a better place so dr would let us begin. thanks!
