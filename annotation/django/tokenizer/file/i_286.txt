We are in the middle of a 15 minute ( and counting ) meltdown from DS that went like this : DS : Mommy , do we eat ice cream in the morning ? Me , ( folding laundry , making breakfast , letting the dog out all at once , not listening : ) Yes . Both my kids : Yay ! Ice cream ! Yay ! Ice cream ! Me , realizing I screwed up : OK , fine , here 's some ice cream in the morning . Just this once . DD : Can I have sprinkles too , Mom ? Me : sure , why not . DS , do you want sprinkles ? DS : ( totally involved in his morning ice cream and not listening ) : Yes . So , I put sprinkles on DS 's ice cream . And then ... http : //www.planetsmilies.com/smilies/mad/mad0214.gif This is him realizing there are sprinkles on his ice cream http : //www.planetsmilies.com/smilies/mad/mad0177.gif http : //www.planetsmilies.com/smilies/fighting/fighting0065.gif ( I 'm the blue one getting pummelled ) We are at the 20 minute mark and he is still screaming . I love my son but I 'd like to take those `` rigidity '' issues and stuff 'em . ./images/smilies/icon_mad.gif He 's so overcome by this new thing on his ice cream that he just took the whole bowl and spoon and dumped it . He ca n't even enjoy the ice cream because it 's not the way he thinks ice cream should be .
