Oh , by the way ... I got a juicer and gave my son celery mixed with fresh pear juice and 2 hours later he was the most curious I 've seen him in a long time ! My son was born with a head size at around 25 % ( i 'm pretty small my babies heads were small ) then his head size jumped up to around 90 % by 6 months . My second daugher did this as well , but she did n't have any problems . I really believe that James is having trouble with brain inflammation , probablly a faulty reaction in his immune system due to so many freakin ' shots at such a young age ! ! here 's another link about the celery . Amazing ! ! ! Jen http : //www.sciencedaily.com/releases/20 ... 094115.htm `` Graduate research assistant Saebyeol Jang studied the inflammatory response in microglial cells . She spurred inflammation by exposing the cells to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , a component of the cell wall of many common bacteria . Those cells that were also exposed to luteolin showed a significantly diminished inflammatory response . Jang showed that luteolin was shutting down production of a key cytokine in the inflammatory pathway , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . The effects of luteolin exposure were dramatic , resulting in as much as a 90 percent drop in IL-6 production in the LPS-treated cells . `` This was just about as potent an inhibition as anything we had seen previously , '' Johnson said . '' Those mice that were fed luteolin had significantly lower levels of IL-6 in their blood plasma four hours after injection with the LPS . Luteolin also decreased LPS-induced transcription of IL-6 in the hippocampus , a brain region that is critical to spatial learning and memory . The findings indicate a possible role for luteolin or other bioactive compounds in treating neuroinflammation , Johnson said . `` Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 are very well known to inhibit certain types of learning and memory that are under the control of the hippocampus ''
