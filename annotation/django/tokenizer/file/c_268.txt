Hi everyone , I recently figured out that a lot of my son 's negative symptoms are related to phenol sensitivity . We started him on curcumin few months ago with initial amazing results but then he started getting extremely anxious , tantrums peaked , complained of chest pain , had difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep , red years , ocd and hyperactivity . I was not familiar with phenol sensitivity then but once I learned about it , we added no phenol by houston enzymes and started epsom salf foot soaks every night . This helped a bit but some days , no phenol and foot soak are not enough especially if he gets any dietary phenols as well . We had good results with curcumin and really would love to continue it . I am cutting down most phenols in his diet now . What else I can do for phenol sensitivity ? I read a bit about sulphur but my son reacted bad to NAC with aggression so not sure if I can use it . Is there a sulfur containing cream which is more effective than epsom salf foot soak/bath ? I found some old messages where people talked about MSM and DMSO but did n't understand much . Can someone please guide me as to what to do ? I started ketotifen this week but his symptoms just worsened although I have read that ketotifen actually helps with phenol sensitivity . Is ketotifen not a good idea for phenol sensitive kids ? I will appreciate all your help . Jk
