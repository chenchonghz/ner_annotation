High blood calcium is caused by a nutritional imbalance . The blood ph has to be within a fraction of a percent of normal to keep calcium in suspension . Otherwise it precipiates out and this is where it is detected as high blood calcium . The imbalance is caused by low choline and low manganese . Choline and manganese together balance the body 's ph levels because they affect the body 's sodium/potassium levels . This in turn keeps the calcium in suspension . Calcium elevates the blood pressure by causing contraction of the heart muscle which causes hyper activity . Manganese is a calcium channel blocker , which will lower the calcium back to normal , as long as choline is present in the proper ratio . Manganese deficiency is noted for aberrent behaviors like lip smacking , eye poking , making odd noises with the tongue , holding the mouth in odd positions , etc . Magnesium lowers manganese levels in the body so not a good idea to supplement with magnesium . Though magnesium is a calming mineral - in the long run it only will make matters worse .
