I just got carnitine levels back from LabCorp . My older two are taking 500mg twice a day of Acetyl L-Carnitine from vitacost.com . My youngest is not . It seemed to make her more irritable , I was n't sure . I figured I could try it again some other time with her . All three of them had levels at the high end of normal . Either , the older two needed it and the younger did n't or it did n't do diddly squat . They are all taking 100mg of CoQ10 from vitacost with NN fish oil in the morning . Yes CoQ10 is fat soluble and should be taken with fats to maximize its absorption . Purebulk.com has good directions for mixing it with coconut oil . I believe , in my humble opinion , that anyone with the COMT mutation would benefit by taking CoQ10 . Maybe someone else can tell us why . This is what I have put together : COMT is linked to Parkinson 's and breast cancer . One way of treating Parkinson 's is with CoQ10 . What I wonder about is does that mean that the mutation inhibits the formation or metabolism of CoQ10 ? The breast cancer connection is also interesting . COMT is the breast cancer gene . If you are low in vitamin D and diagnosed with breast cancer your chances of morbidity go way up . I wonder if maintaining high levels of D will prevent breast cancer ? I have the mutation and my D levels were below 20 . I figured the investment in CoQ10 and D supplements was well worth it .
