Ever since getting into Biomed I have started my ADHD on stuff you all have mentioned . No Dr involved and none to help . The good news is Today for the FIRST time this year I got an extra special note home . To explain how wonderful Daniel had been ALL week . Reminder he is ADHD not Autistic . He take Dr meds and has been on them for most of the year so this was definatly because of the stuff I am doing . I would like some help just incase I am doing something wrong or you have something else that will help that I may have missed . So here is my list if someone has the energy to read it and just give me any pointers . Omega 3 1000mg 3x daily Grape Seed ex 120mg 2x GABA 150mg 3x Magnesium 250mg 1x Turmeric 450mg 1x Zinc 50 mg 1x Acidophilus 1x DHEA 25mg 1x Milk Thistle 1000mg 2x Calcium 1000mg 2x Selenium 200mg 1x Phosphatidlyserine 100 mg 2x thought about moving up to 500mg B complex 2x Echinacea w/ vitamin C 2x 5-HTP 1x Borage Oil 500mg 2x Melatonin 3mg 1x EPO was giving but cant find it affordable also saw Melatonin in micrograms and wondered about adding that and no he does not complain about taking them has always swallowed pills since he was 4 any suggestions would really be appricated I know it sounds like alot but if you saw how my nephew turned out taking the DR.s meds you would understand . I would rather go naturally .
