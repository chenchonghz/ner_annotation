They tested just about everything . Hes good on most of the results , but the ones he is not are some of the most important . Folate Choline Fructose intolerance Glutathione ( the big one ) Total antioxidant fuction LPI ? It tells me that giving him 100mg vitamin C , E Selenium will help with the antioxidants . He must have an absorbtion problem because we already give 1500 mg of C. He does need more Selenium and E. I also need to go back to full vitamins , where we cut everything in half because of liverlife . WE have a phone consult with DAN in a few days to go over results.I need to look some of this up . Just thought i would share results . kelly
