Carnosine is helping but ... .it 's possible to over do it . If I take 1000 mg per day it causes awful anxiety in social situation . I mean anxiety like I never felt before . Will be keeping to 500 mg L-carnatine/day for now . Keeps me mellow and upbeat . Its also easier to deal with people . Have stopped taking 500 mg L-carnatine as it causes an annoying headache . I can stop the headache by taking carnisone which incidentally is useful for dealing with pain . Also found that 1000 mg each of arginine and lysine helps me feel very relaxed and calm . Taken before bed it helps sleep . So between carnosine , lysine and arginine I 'm doing better but its still early days . Its worth noting that the body is able to convert lysine to carnatine by itself .
