As others have advised please take care and caution when using ALA it is more than a powerful antioxidant . It is a chelator and must be used as one . Please use ALA every 3 hours , as it is the half-life of ALA. . Every 4 hours is the MAX time allowed to dose , used properly as a chelator . I dunno how long you have been using ALA and what the body weight is in that child , But from our experience when dosed more frequently in the proper amount of childs body weight we have had better success with no regressions . Prior to switching protocol chelation was a mess . I am only sharing this because what we have learned and observed with others over the years in regard to chelation and regressions . A few notes : We have chelated well over 2 years now and have added in our chelation protocol ALA. We use DMSA/ALA every 3 hours dosing schedule ( 4 hours max at nigh time dosing ) This is known as the Ac protocol slow and steady I have read many reports of regressions also spoke to parents with its use and warrant the warnings especially from those just starting off in chelation and most definitely non-verbal children who can not tell you how they feel . . Btw I have also used ALA and could tell you from my own experience of how little of the chelator is needed to be an effective chelator and how the frequency directly effects how you feel . We all believe if dosed infrequently , it can cause redistribution and in many cases that are what we believe have observed in chelation our children . As aside note some believe it does cross the BBB and would be another reason why do dose it based on its half-life as well . If you do follow the work of Andy Cutler and are open to understand why he advises NOT to use ALA at all if you are not going to use it properly .
