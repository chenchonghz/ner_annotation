hi guys , im new to the site . My son was diagnosed with autistic disorder 299.00 ( generic autism ? ) in January . he was having trouble going to sleep and it would take 2 hours or so to finally get him to sleep so we started giving him 1mg of melatonin about 30 minutes before bedtime and it gets him to sleep but he still wakes up in the middle of the night . He is 2 1/2 and weighs about 38 lbs . we have a 5lb weighted blanket for him but it still doesnt seem to work . We put him to bed around 7-7:30 each night and he wakes up between 11 and 1 in the morning and climbs into bed with me and the wife . Should we try upping the doseage on the melatonin ? I just ordered some super nu thera , folic acid , and dmg supplements from kirkman to try those out .
