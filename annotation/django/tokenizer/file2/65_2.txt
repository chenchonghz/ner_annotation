IMHO, if you can afford it, get your ds supplemental therapy. You can let him go to school for limited hours for the social skill and the opportunity to learn to function away from you. If the school system is providing subpar therapy, you should try to find a way to get good quality therapy while you iron out things with the SD. I was in the same shoes, it took too much out of us emotionally trying to appeal to our SD. We just opt out. Hopefully there will be better offering later down the line. We were not going to waste our ds' time while some people take the time to catch up to the present. Our child is our primary focus. We had to either move to another district or pay privately. For now our only option is to pay privately for quality. I hope things work out well for you and your ds.  Concernedpa.
