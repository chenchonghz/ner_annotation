While NCD zeolite is totally safe , there 's some clinical studies being developed specifically to look at zeolite and autism . Check out zeoliteautismstudy.com . Lots of good information . Here 's some more links I 've found : audio-autism1.zeoliteautismstudy.com - Dr. Prociuk , a Dan doctor , experience with his asd patients . audio-autism2.zeoliteautismstudy.com - another call audio-rik1.zeoliteautismstudy.com - Rik is a biochemist working with zeolite . www.zeoliteinfo.org - lots of testimonials in various areas a place to buy ncd at a discount - www.marlana.org/ncd-zeolite.htm My DAN doctor put Alex , my 4 yr old on ncd 4 weeks ago . He has been making great improvements . He 's responding with only 1 request instead of 10 to 12 , he told his sister he loves her and gave her a hug ! ! He had n't done this for over a year . I can not hardly believe all the changes . I pray it continues . He has become really hyperactive . I had to cut back on the dose . Has anyone else seen this ? Thanks , Elaine
