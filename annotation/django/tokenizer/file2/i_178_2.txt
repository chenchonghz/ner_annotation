You can try TMG if the irritability does n't go away , but first try folinic acid and see if that helps . I give my daughter TMG/Folic/MB12 sublinguals . She did n't do well with DMG . Also , if your son has yeast overgrowth issues , DMG and Folic or any B vitamin are big yeast feeders and the yeast will cause irritability and more autistic behaviours.- Ruby 4 in February moderate autism , Clara 14 months NT so far
