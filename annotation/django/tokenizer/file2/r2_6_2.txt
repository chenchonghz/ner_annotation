Sorry to hear of the nasty experience you went through with the psychiatrists and medications ... Just out of curiousity ... . What were the meds given to you ? I ask that coz I have a special interest in Bipolar ... . coz I 'm one myself . I 'm currently on Sodium Valproate ( Epilim ) , two tablets , twice a day.- Trust in the Lord with all your heart ... lean not on your own understanding
