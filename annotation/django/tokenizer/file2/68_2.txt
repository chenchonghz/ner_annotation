Lynette, DON'T mind your own business. The sooner a proper diagnosis is made, the sooner help can be had. Better to be tested and not have anything going on than to hope it's nothing and find out later it was...and could have been helped. Oh, and our young one would eat pancakes 3 meals a day if we let him. Protein powder has us feeling a little better on that one. Sour gummy bear vitamins also are acceptable to him. Strangely, he will also eat a homemade sun-dried tomato pesto pizza with ham diced in very fine. He used to eat Pad Thai from a local Thai hole-in-the-wall until they accidentaly made it spicy.  The older guy is getting more adventurous. Unfortunatley, he loves shrimp and lobster...and NY steak.- Father of 2, an 8-year-old with HFA, and a 4-year-old with Mild-Mod.
