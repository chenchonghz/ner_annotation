When I did the challange test with my son we grinded up the DSMA pills and gave them to him with water . I am wondering if I can do the same thing with apple juice to make it taste a bit better ? We are just starting our first cycle of oral DSMA treatment and I have the directions from the dr but am not sure about the apple juice/ . thanks , Jessica .
