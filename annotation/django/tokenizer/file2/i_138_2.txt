You could do epson salt baths which will help soothe the bottom and allow the body to absorb magnesium and/ or you can give a magnesium supplement until you see the stool soften . This was an issue with my son and we increased his intake of magnesium supps . Definately try the digestive enzymes too . Something else to consider is if there is any bacterial problems in the gut as well . Thanks . I have an update as well . I took Corinn in to the doctor , they did an x ray and she is very backed up . Basically , she is full of **** ! ! ! ! The gave her an edema and prescribed her miralax . So , I go back in 2 weeks . She has been off her probiotics ect because she has hardly been eating . I am trying to get them down her , but am worried she just poops them out . She does take calcium with magnesium and B6 with magnesium/ She just got the b6+mag so it is very new and not introduced much .
