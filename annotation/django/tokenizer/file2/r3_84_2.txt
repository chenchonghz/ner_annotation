thanks for the reply : ) yes , he 's on clonodine and melatonin at the moment , having tried Ritalin and Dexamphetamine with bad results . Unfortunately , being at the police station , and despite having a very sympathetic ( and firm ) police officer , it doesnt seem to have had any great effect ( ie came home and caused mayhem and more ) . I cant tell him he will go live with his dad as he knows that will never happen , although I have mentioned a residential school ( not what I want , but you 'll try anything right ? ) Despite being medicated he wont sit , and will quite often refuse point blank to do anything he doesnt want to do . his med seem to keep his migraines at bay ( which were horrific before ) but not much else . I 've been trying over and over to explain where he will end up if things continue but he just doesnt see it . I 'm sure I sound very negative at the moment , apologies for that.Edited by pinksparkles on November 06 2005 at 4:36pm- Fi x
