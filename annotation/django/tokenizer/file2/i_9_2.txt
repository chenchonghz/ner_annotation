I took my sons to have them start the chelation process . I spent over a thousand dollars on blood tests and office visits . They were not started on the process because their zinc was low . I gave them zinc and was ready to start the process , but was told they would need more blood tests ( several more hundred dollars ) . Has this been your experience as well ? How did you get your daughter on the process , how costly is it for you and how long did it take to get her started ? My twin sons are 6 . Also , are there other postings on the benefits on chelation . I am leary with what I have experienced with the doctor I was going to . - Annette
