In another study , NIMH researchers will examine the use of the antibiotic minocycline to measure its usefulness in treating regressive autism . Past research suggests that autism may be linked to changes in the immune response that cause inflammation in the brain . A third study addresses the widespread but unproven theory that autism may be treated successfully by chelation therapy , which seeks to remove heavy metals from the blood . Chelation is more commonly used to treat lead toxicity , but many families seek the treatment to try to remove mercury and other metals from their autistic children 's blood . This practice is based on the belief that many cases of autism were caused by exposure to thimerosol , a mercury-based preservative previously used in childhood vaccines .
