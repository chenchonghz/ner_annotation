Well here is my update so far ... neuro is faxing papers for lab work ... sometimes Depakote ( one of his seizure meds ) can cause anemia ... even though he had labwork done last month she said it could still be an option ... also she wants ammonia levels checked ... again the depakote can raise levels , which can result in sleepiness . His psych wants to decrease his zyprexa by half in the morning ... dropping him down to 2.5mg ... she said she does n't believe it is the meds , but that is usually the first route to go when things like this appear . I , myself , do n't really feel that it is one of his meds causing the problems , seems more of a shutdown than a medical , but I guess we wo n't know until we examine everything . Thanks for all the help , I will keep you posted .
