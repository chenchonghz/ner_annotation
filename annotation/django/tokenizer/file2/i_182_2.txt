thank you ! ! my head is sorta spinning trying to figure things out . i use mag oil b/c the smallest mag was giving him loose stools , i tried several different kinds , previously when i gave him the mag there were good benefits but he was eating a bedtime snack with it , now i ca n't rely on if he will eat the snack , but back then there were no poop issues with the absorption of the mag . we tried meds for 2 years so i did n't introduce supps at the same time , just recently we did craniosacral for 3 months so did n't want to introduce anything at that time either ... ..now i 've stopped zyrtec , i read some horror stories with zyrtec and wonder if that has made jason `` off '' for the past two years , jason was always `` on and off '' now he is just `` off '' he 's shut down , the potential he has shown is very promising . i am writing a book ! ! also when i added the dmg with folic and b12 he was nuts so researching that i found some kids ca n't handle the folic , so now i stopped his rx multi , i always knew too many b 's made him nuts that 's why i gave the rx chewable , it 's not that fortified.. i just joined autismweb.com and asked them a few questions , they were helpful . i am not going to add anything until i figure out if the zyrtec has affected him , any thoughts on how long i should give that ? also , did your son have an MRI , do you know many autistic kids that have brain damage on MRI ? jason has cerebral palsy and his MRI shows PVL , i do n't beleive jason is a gut kid or am i kidding myself : )
