I also use a lot of supplements and we divide it up throughout the day and mix as many as possible ( and avoid conflicts of enyzmes ) Before breakfast , 2 enyzmes . Pfeiffer multivit in first 'cocoa and rice milk ' plus some Ca/Mg powder . more powder in second cocoa and before being given that , he has antiviral and yeast aid mixed in low GI jam Lunch , some enzymes mixed in melted chocolate ( and frozen for up to 2 weeks ) , plus vit C pill , 2 enyzme pills . In jam- antiviral , drop vit A , acetly L carnitine plus depending on day , vit D , vit E , selenium Tea- same with enzymes and antiviral , MTpromoterII , pfeiffer primer mixed in jam . fish oil before bedtime cocoa and then rub cream in before he has story . We are a well oiled machine now.. It was hard at first but he is used to it now and he gets the spoonful of jam before the nice tasting chewables . We used to mix them into his tea but some were heat sensitive and the zinc in the primer is so disgusting he was nto eating his tea so we re thought things.- Rachel mum to Riley ( Aspergers 5yo ) and Jemma ( 3yo )
