I have not yet done any chelation on my son (Patrick, 5 years) because no one has convinced me yet that it is safe. From my readings to date ( I am a DAN taught doctor) it seems as if most agents can definitely mobilize the metals but what happens to them after that can not be guaranteed. In other words, you might just cause more metals that were previously in other tissues, to now leak into the brain. It's not a firm science. Therefore, I am a bit reluctant to try it just yet. Instead, why not just support the child's own liver function (the liver is the detoxifier of the body) with some supplements for now. It's probably also helpful to give things like Vit C, etc that detoxify as well. Anad melatonin can also be good for detox (yet I have some concerns there too - see my melatonin posting). Just my opinion. I have patients in my practice who are chelating with another doctor too as I don't offer this. so far, no great responses.    - Wendy
