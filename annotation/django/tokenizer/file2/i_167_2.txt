Hello - I am new to the board . I have a 4 1/2 yr. old son on the ASD . ( Heavy metal poisn . from vaccines ! ) Just wanted to share some info about Melatonin . My son had a DAN appt . this past week . Dr. said that it is good to use melatonin with Taurine too . Helps melatonin work better , and that melatonin not only helps with sleep , but increases glutathione levels too . We have been using melatonin for about 1 month or so ( 47pds - gets 3mg ) . But we did not use everynight . I was afraid too , but the DAN doc said it actually is better to use everynight and to give the Taurine ( 1000mg by Kirkman ) right along with it at bedtime . I think I will switch to the slow release too - because your right it puts them to sleep but does not keep him asleep . Trish Mom2Michael
