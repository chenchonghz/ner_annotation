According to Research Autism ( an organization Simon Baron-Cohen is involved in ) , it 's okay to use SSRI 's on adults with autism , but not on children . They write : '' The use of antidepressant drugs to treat autistic abnormalities in children can not be recommended on the basis of current evidence and because there are concerns about the harm due to SSRI induced activation and agitation . `` `` Their use should only be considered in specialist settings taking particularly into consideration subject selection and dosage . Methodologically sound studies are needed . `` Out of 40 studies on antidepressives and autism , only three of them had satisfactory methodology , such as using a control group who got a placebo ( without the participants or researchers in direct contact with them knowing who got the placebo and who got the real thing ) .

They found that the placebo was actually more effective than the drug in reducing repetitive behavior ! And the drug had side effects like impulsivity and insomnia . The researchers interpreted this as suggesting that autistic stimming does n't have the same origin in the brain as OCD . http : //www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-autism-drugs2-200 9jun02,0,6717060.storyI hope your child 's doctor is willing to discuss your questions with you before proceeding . - Norway Mom ( mother of 2 sons who were born in 1998 and 2001 .
