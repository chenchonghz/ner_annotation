My daughter got put on an antibiotic for an ear infection about 2 weeks ago for 10 days . Within 2 days of being on it , she was a completely different child . She was responding to her name , she was repeating words , talking , playing with toys normally and stopped eating paper ( normally anything paper-like that she can get her hands on gets eaten ) . In less than a week of being off the antibiotic she regressed back to how she was before . We 've conversed with both her doctors and although they could n't really think of anything , they put her back on the antibiotic again to see if we 'd see the same change ... and we did ! We 've gotten back in touch with the doctors to see what they want to do from here to try to figure out why the antibiotic seems to lessen her autistic features . Anyone ever seen this happen in their child ? I 've tried researching to see if I can come up with any ideas for them to look into but have n't had much luck.- Carrie , Loving mother to Tyson 6/2/05 NT Kyann 11/28/06 ASD-no official dx yet
