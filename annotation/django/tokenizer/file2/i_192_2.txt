Hello I have a 3year old daughter with autism . She was recently very ill with Kawaski syndrome . She had to be hospitalzed for 3days to recieve IVIG and be observed afterwards . That was about 2 weeks ago . She totally flabergasted me because she is saying 6 word sentences , identifying and saying the letters of words , talking more , more sociable , happier and has a better appetite . I have read some information on the benefits of IVIG today . I am just amazed of the things she 's been saying a doing the past week . Does anyone have any information on IVIG therapy and how it effects autism . Thanks
