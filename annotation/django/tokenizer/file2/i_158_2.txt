Hi everyone , I have been doing a lot of digging with regards to all the different types of vitamins and minerals to incorporate in an autistic child 's diet and am finding my way around very confusing . There is a great deal of information , but which protocol is best for my 4-year-old PDD NOS son ( high function ) Maybe you could help . Please ! First of all Super Nu Thera , and DMG ( is it correct to say that DMG is also called B15 ? ) both are a B6 and magnesium supplements , right ? If so which one to use and how have you found using it ? Also , what about Spectrum Support by ChildBrian ? Is n't this essentially the same ? I heard too much B6 could cause hyperactivity , therefore , since each supplement has high levels of B6 , would it be fair to say that one should not give both supplements to their child ? And how about Colostrum Gold ? Has anyone tried that ? And what calcium replacement if on a GF/CG diet do you know of . One link I read said to use plain old Tums . Is that enough or is there enough calcium in either one of the above-mentioned supplements ? And does anyone use Coromega or cod liver oil for Omega 3 intake ? You see my confusion ? Any advise from you pros would be appreciated . Thanks , Tessa
