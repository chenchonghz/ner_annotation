I think that sight you referenced pretty much says it all ... ... an experienced physician to oversee any chelation program is essential . Both myself and my two children are currently chelating and we are fine . Great , in fact . And , the referenced deaths were in the fifties . The only other deaths I know of from chelation were due to physician error and once again , that goes back to researching your Dr. and making sure they know what they are doing . And yes , it is worth the risk . In my mind , it 's no more dangerous than chemotherapy , really ... not to mention that the side effects of chemotherapy are as bad if not worse . But would you hesitate to put your child through that if a Dr. recommended it for cancer ? - The struggles I 'm facing The chances I 'm taking Sometimes might knock me down But no I 'm not breaking- The Climb
