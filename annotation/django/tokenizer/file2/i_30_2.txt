If I do something like that it would have to be iv because my 8 year old would not take any medications at all by mouth even if I try to mix it with something that he might like I have a difficult time when he is sick and needs even tylenol or any antibiotic it has to be injected to get rid off the infection . I would like to hear from parents that are trying this and how do you even start ? and have you seen any improvement ? thanks
