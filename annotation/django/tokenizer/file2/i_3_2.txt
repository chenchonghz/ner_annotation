Chelation is actually a medical process that has to be executed , supervised and prescribed by a physician either orally , via supository , interveniously , or transdermally . And I agree-even if I could-I would not under go such a therapy without the supervision . With medical chelation-it is possible that while the metals are being extracted from the cells that they can be redeposited before the are excreted from the body . Potentially doing more harm than good . Apparently with clathration-all natural ingredents ( algea and good bacteria like those found in yogurt , plus additional ingreidents ) are used to to extract the metals from the cells and completely surround them preventing them from being re-deposited . It is just a supplement and not a prescription . The mother that told me about it said that her pediatrician suggested it to her . The more I say the more I feel like this sounds like some sort of sales pitch-and I promise you I am not selling anything . I work for an insurance agency in MI that is very opposed to experimental treatments & amp ; I actually just spent my entire paycheck on these supplements . Thus the reason I am desperatly looking for some sort of feedback on any experience anyone has had with this and or similar products . Today was our third day of the spray , and I can honestly say that my son has been far more cooperative today-and ( and I know this may seem trivial ) he actually drank water today . My son drinks nothing but milk/gatorade . That 's it . Never strays . Milk or Gatorade . Today-he asked for `` Ice Water '' . I almost fell down . Again-any and all feedback is welcome . I purchased the supplement from www.awakennutrition.com . Anyone with experience with this , or even if you look at the web site and see any red flags I should be aware of . Thanks For Listening- Carly
