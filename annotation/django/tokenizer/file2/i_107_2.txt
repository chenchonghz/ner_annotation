My little one started prozac in Jan and it has helped her in so many ways she is able to go to school , ST , PT , OT with out me . She more engaged with others - greeting people with a hi we never heard before . She is also able to talk around others vs only talk around `` her peeps '' . We also have to use med to help her sleep these we have been on for 1.5 yrs I know most people are anti meds but with out these my DD could not eat-sleep-function in our world . We also use melitonin - clonidin - risperdal - trazadone - zertec - and omegas -proboitic-stomach enzimes- CF My little one is only 3yr old and only taking 4mgs of prozac I hope it help you as much
