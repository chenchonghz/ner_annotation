I knew a 5 yo boys with asd that was given risperidal for outbursts that were becoming more severe and violent . He gained a lot of weight . It worked for a little while , then he started acting angry and crying all the time . He was also refusing to use the toilet . They decided to stop the med . And he 's back to normal before he had the outbursts . I do not have asd , but have taken Risperidone ( adult version of Risperidal ) for obsessive/cyclical negative thinking during a depressive episode . I had tons of side effects , like lactating ( ) , weight gain , loss of menses , muscle aches , and general moodiness . And this was on a low dose . Luckily , my Dr. was smart and rxed me Seroquel at the same time to counter the effects of the Risperidone ( I shudder to think what the effects would have been if there had not been anything to counteract the effects ! ! ! ) . We have gotten rid of Risperidone , and stayed on the low dose of Seroquel , and now I am doing much better . I hear asd kids can be rxed Seroquel . It still has some weight gain issues , but it works great and it helps you sleep ( best if taken at night ) . This site has been amazing for me to research the meds I am taking , and may help you : http : //www.crazymeds.us/- DS - 3yrs , 8months - Autism
