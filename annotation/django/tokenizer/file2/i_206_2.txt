My doctor who is not an alternative or DAN doctor prescribed the methyl b-12 injectable kind for my little boy who is now 4yrs old and diagnosed with autism . Here is the Rx information : methycobalamin ( 25mg/ml ) 12.9 mg or 0.5ml injected every 3 days . insuline syringes # 30 or 3d *cant tell the handwriting LOL* according to Dr Nuebrander 's website he recommends `` 64.5 mcg/kg once every 3 days to the adipose tissue of the buttocks at an angle severe and horizontal enough to guarantee a & # 147 ; shallow & # 148 ; subcutaneous delivery from a BD 3/10 cc insulin syringe with an 8 mm , 31-gauge needle , item # 328438 only , and made from a 25 mg/ml methyl-B12 stock solution '' http : //www.drneubrander.com/Files/Methyl-B12 ; % 20Myth , % 20Mast erpiece , % 20or % 20Miracle.doc I am concerned that his pediatrician prescribed maybe an inadequate prescription . I see some differences . Not sure . For those who tried it and still using it for your children , did your doctor follow Nuebrander 's method ? If not did you still see results ? Do you even see results concerning Nuebranders method ? Did anybodys doctor prescribe it like mines ? Does that kind work ? Highly concerned ! ! ! I rather get it right the first time so I can properly see if this works for my little boy ... .
