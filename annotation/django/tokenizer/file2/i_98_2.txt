Oh , that was a typo on my part . It should be 3-6-9 . That 's an Omega 3 , Omega 6 and Omega 9 supplement , fish oil basically . My knowledge is limited but the ratio of 3/6/9 oils may be important in their effectiveness . Some people believe it can be a beneficial supplement for Autistic people . A diet high in these oils is good for everyone . It 's good for your nervous system and heart so it ca n't hurt.I 've been thinking of trying a wheat and dairy free diet on my son . While it 's easy to reduce those items in his diet it 's difficult to eliminate them , especially when there are siblings involved . So I 'm trying a reduces wheat and dairy diet and having him take the enzymes before eating . Even that is a difficult task since he could forget to take one if he fixes his own meal . Ideally , you can get a test done to see if there is sensitivity to these foods . What happens is some individuals ca n't digest proteins found in wheat ( gluten ) and in milk ( caseins ) . When the proteins are n't digested properly they turn into an opiate like toxin that attacks the brain . That is where the enzymes may help.What is n't clear is some people that have the problem may not be autistic but just have the problem digesting these proteins . The symptoms manifest much like autism but usually start a little later in life ( once food is eaten ) . However , there is some evidence that this diet could help autism as well . I know my son has some digestive issues but he was also symptomatic from birth . Yet he is very high functioning . Bottom line is I do n't know but there is tons of research out there and some good books .
