Hi , I 'm new but love some of the posts here . Just love the sharing of schedules , ect ... there is a few books with ideas , also `` A childs journey out of Autism '' , by Leann Whiffen has a list of meds , suplmts , ect ... We have to heal our own kids and we ca n't count on anyone else ( gov and ama ) , but we have a huge amount of help available from other parents on the front line . Think long range , it helps . Our schedule now ; am -1/2 Perque b-12 , 1/2 neoro . vit , 1 drop r n a , 1 squirt nasonex , some Calm child , 1 Aeura-shingles formula ( for hand warts ) mid-day - ( or after school ) - 1/2 Actos , 1/4 of both Intrinsic b-12 and Folopro , DHA gel ( He eats them , yuk ) , 1 Aeura-shingles formula pm - 1 melatonin ( sublingal so he eats ) about 8 pm . try to add other things , but not consistent enough . Most of these We crush and put in juice . p.s . if I ca n't afford a new book or video , I request our library system to order . Then more people get help than just us .
