Hi Johnny . You 'll find some adults on here with formal diagnosis , but alot of us are struggling each day with our own autistic quirks and probably will never be diagnosed as adults . My ex husband has a formal diagnosis now , and he 's a member here . Your story sounds remarkably like mine . My dad is a human calculator . My uncle has some severe rigidity going on in his life . Another uncle has major social anxiety and `` self medicated '' for years . My kids ' genetic makeup was pretty much doomed from the start , but I do the best I can each day . Working in human services to help people on the spectrum is an awesome goal and I hope you go very far in your career . I 'm thinking about going back to college for my masters in special education because that seems to be my best option right now . God knows we need teachers who understand the spectrum , and since I almost have a degree in elementary education , I 'll get accepted into the masters program at the local university . I just want to make the world a little better place for people on the spectrum ... Glad to meet you.- Mary , Mom to B ( 5.5 - ASD , apraxia , SPD , PICA , saying more words every day ) and J ( 3 - Educational label of developmentally delayed , finally verbal , OCD traits , ADHD traits )
