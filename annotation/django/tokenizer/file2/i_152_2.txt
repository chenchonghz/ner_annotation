Hello everyone . My two boys have been drinking mangosteen juice as a natural anti-inflammatory/anti-oxydant but the specific company/juice we were using is one of those multi-level marketing deal , ( in which we never participated in that way , we just bought the juice for the boys without trying to recruit anyone else ) , and the juice did show some results in both boys but now this company is upping their prices and adding a yearly `` aministration fee '' on top of it all and with two boys drinking it ( on top of all the other supplements we buy for them already ) , we simply can no longer afford this particular company 's juice . Has anyone tried anything similar for anti-inflammatory/anti-oxydant properties and could you please share with us ? Anything available from Kirkman Labs ? or from the grocery store ? I 'm willing to juice it myself or mix it with some other juice they drink . I want to make sure my boys still benefit from the anti-inflammatory properties if I can afford it ( and without the pressures of trying to recruit people all the time ) Thanks for any help you can give me .
