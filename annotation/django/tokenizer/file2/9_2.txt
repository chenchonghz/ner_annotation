We are in the same boat . Just met with DAN dr. last month ... waiting anyday for the metals test back from France . Dying to know either way . Dr. said that we ca n't do anything that 's not homeopathic at this point , because she has elevated liver enzymes . We are getting ready to start homeopathic yeast supossitories , and have been on b12 shots for about 3 weeks ... amazing results with her langauge so far ! Not GFCF yet because the girl wo n't eat . Pretty much gets pediasure . Let us know what you find out ! I 'm am so nervous waiting for these results..UUGGHH ! ! - Mom to five gorgeous girls , 4 big sisters are nt , youngest is asd , 4 yo
