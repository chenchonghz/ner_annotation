Just wanted to say that taurine in GABA is also in Red Bull and other energy drinks . Most of these say not recommended for children . Not sure if this is because of taurine or garauna ( sp ? ) or high amount of caffeine but be careful what you give your kids . Herbs are not regulated by FDA and some are harmful to children . Research carefully and ask your doc 's opinion .
