Yes I totally agree with the others . My son 's PDOC has suggested Haldol but ONLY because we 've been through every other AntiPsychotic that exits , all the mood stabilizers , and several other meds and the kid is so aggressive we are afraid he may have to be put in residential . That 's where WE have been at BEFORE Haldol even got mentioned . I seriously doubt your 3 yr old has been through that much of a `` med wringer '' yet . Mine is 6 and his meds started at 2 so that 's 4 YEARS before even Haldol was put forth for consideration . ( p.s . I opted out of this med for right now . It is a VERY scary med ) - Joellen Tahia ( 9 , Highly gifted ) Tariq ( 6 , Autism , ADHD , 8p23.1 chromosome deletion , Ebstein 's Anomaly )
