Hi,  I am new here. I am really excited to find a message board designed around people going through the same thing. I have a three year old who is about to undergo chelation treatment in a couple of months. We see a DAN (defeat autisim now) doctor. We are going to be using DMSA chelation.  The way our doctor explained it was the mercury from vaccinations gets stored in fat. So it doesnt show up on the blood, urine,stool, hair tests. We have only found very elevated levels of tin so far in the blood work. So we are going to doa challenge test with chelation to bring some of the mercury back out into the bloodstream and re-test for mercury. His toxicity has caused major bowel upset and lead to leaky gut syndrome. He had over twelve ear infections, and has now been able to go for long periods of time without. I would love to hear from anyone who has advice or just wants to chat :)- Noelle  Mom to three boys  Zack 5, Blake 3, Nolan 1
