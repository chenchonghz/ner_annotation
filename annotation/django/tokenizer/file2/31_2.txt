I am trying to find glutathione and chelation. I have found glutathione online however would like to get some today...What is the dose for children? I have a 4 year old ......I just found out about this and hope it's not too late to try...I read a story on a actress on the 2020 abc website...she was on a high protein diet and ate fish 4x a week and had high levels of mercury...her treatment was the chelation and the glutathione...I also read that epson salt baths are good...on another site...any truth to that? I am going to have my daughter taken in to her Doc to get a read on her levels b4 we give her anything...However I don't trust Doc's 100% no one has ever suggested to check for Mercury and due to the increase in Autistic children you would think they would make that a routein check up....
