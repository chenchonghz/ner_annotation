Hi There I just started the DMG supplement and have noticed a bit of hyperactivity over the past 2 days . We started very slow- only 5 drops in the morning . But I am wondering : Some of you mentioned that your kids needed DMG with folinic acid or TMG instead . Was hyperactivity something you had noticed ?
