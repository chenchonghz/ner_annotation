Did you know that the latest autism research has shown very low levels of total cholesterol among children suffering from autism ? The lower the level , the more severley affected.Did you also know that almost every neurodegenerative disease has altered cholesterol synthesis and degradation as an underlying factor ? Did you know that infant formula now contains DHA , which is widely known for its triglyceride lowering effect ? Did you know that the manufacturers of this synthetic DHA have no idea what affect supplementation will have on synthesis or excretion of cholesterol ? Oh , I bet there is a lot that you do n't know.Big money has a way of keeping these little secrets.I know these things because I have asked those who should provide answers.They are not talking.I know because I have spent three years researching and sorting through fact and fiction .
