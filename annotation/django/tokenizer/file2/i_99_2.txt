so I guess this could explain why at 17 I sort of `` cracked '' and had all these nutty ideas and anger and stuff/ ? ? I had to be put in hospital two different times ... ... ... I was misdiagnosed as bipolar ... ... ... ..and the meds made me INSANE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I did n't always know who I was really and what the h*** was going on ... ... ... ... my personality was different ... ... ... ..I was mean ... ... ... .very mean ... ... to my parents at one time I thought they were gon na kill me or something crazy like that ... ... ... ... . I was put on so many different meds ... ... ... ... ..at one time I was taking 13 pills a day ... ... ... ... ... it was horrific . but meds can work for autistics too ... ... ... ... .just not lithium and lamictal and depakote and seroquel all at once ... ... ... ..at least , not for me . Now I just take Concerta for adhd and klonopin for anxiety when I need it . the fact that autistics metabolize meds differently and have different reactions to them , makes sense . I was very reactive to the meds ... ... ..and parents never believed me when I told them about side effects etc ... ... ..but that 's all over now . and here is how I was finally able to quit them ... ... ... ... I left home without telling anyone . I did call home 24 hours later and tell them I was safe ... ... ..I did n't say exactly where I was , because I did n't want them coming after me . My main reason for doing that was to get off the meds , because I felt like they were poisoning me . and no way in heck my parents would have let me quit at home . I get along soooooooo much better with them now . Everyone is happy ... ... ... ... . more on that later , if anyone is interested . AI - Athena Ivan
