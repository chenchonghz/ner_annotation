I take a flintstone vitamin every morning b/c that 's what the girls get and it just simplifies things . ( BTW Flinstones are the only multi-vitamins right now that contain choline which is ESSENTIAL for brain health but if you eat 2 eggs a day you are prob . getting the choline you need in your diet . They used to think if you do n't eat the choline your body would make it but now they are saying it does n't . DH has a Ph.D. in biopolymer chemistry and he had me eating 2 eggs/day when I was pg w/ Rebecca . Flintstones have recently added choline . ) I feel really overweight and lately when I see pictures of myself I am really surprised b/c I look average , not obese which is what I see in my mind 's eye . I used to be really skinny though ( before kids and after my first was born ) . I would like to be more active . I used to play volleyball whenever possible and now I am lucky to play at a picnic once a year . DH was diagnosed w/ celiac disease this year but has probably had it for over 10 years . I used to cook 6 nights/week and on Sunday he 'd get a pizza but no more pizza parlor pizza for him . On a GF diet his cholesterol and BP have gone down . - Meg
