I always arrange for someone to watch my son while I talk to his teacher , have IEP meetings , ect so that he does n't hear anything being said about him . I constantly have to tell strangers not to touch him , he is amazingly cute but I do n't think that is why they do it , and having weirdos touch him is very upsetting for him . It 's so stupid , it 's like telling someone who is freaking out to `` just relax '' seriously that is the last thing you want to hear when you are upset . Patting someone on the head is the most condescending thing you can do to someone , it is so insulting ! Seriously , why ca n't people keep their hands to themselves . I remember when I was pregnant , people would always touch my belly , not just co-workers , even perfect strangers . One day I went on a home visit , since I was pregnant I always took another officer with me , well , that day I did a surprise visit on an alcoholic gang banger and he reached out to touch my belly as he was asking me what I was having , and the officer with me slammed him to the ground and cuffed him . He was my favorite co-worker after that ! lol i bet one of my friends who is pregent is going through this right now it really bugging her she only in her 4 month you cant tell she is i said you need to set up boundey an tell people they canbt see your belly or touch you .she said the next time someone say let me see your belly she going to say let me see your first lmao .i think people tend to treat adultds with disibiltys whatever they are like were big kids an we are not i swear i get ask qustion that i dont think they ask a nt adult .so when i do guss speaking i talk about that an i remind my parents about what i talk about with who anb not .my dad say you have a right like everyone else .i ntold my dad that it annoying that everyone think iyt ok to no my biz buut i dont no everyone else personile stuff since i becanme an adult an got better verble skill i been controling what people no about me an not .i felt like an open book for along time .im glad you asrte doiung what you do with your son .it will help him to not feel bad about himself hearinmg convertion a bout him as those he a non person- They 're working on a pill to cure ignorance..I got an order in for a whole case so that I can hand them out to all of the ignorant people that I know im an adult with autism an ld
