Hi . My son is 2 1/2 and diagnosed with pdd nos . He 's been on singulair consistently since October 08 . We took him off of it about 2 weeks ago . Since then , slowly but surely he started saying some words CONSISTENTLY . That is , not saying something randomly and never saying it again , but consciously repeating what we ask him to repeat , and even several times on his own . I even noticed that his eye contact is a little better . He never had any aggressive behavior while on the med , contrary to some people who have reported this side effect . Medical professionals and pharmacists , along with many forums say that singulair is an excellent drug and has not been known to contribute to symptoms of autism and/or pdd , and that this may be a BIG coincidence . But that 's just it - how big of a coincidence can it be ? Someone on one of the forums mentioned that there 's a doctor somewhere doing a study on how singulair might help to cure symptoms of autism - that 's the first time I ever heard anything like that . I do n't want to give singulair a bad rap unless there was a good reason , bec . actually it really is very effective for asthma/allergy sufferers . My son had a lot less asthmatic symptoms when he 'd get sick . With summer approaching we decided to take him off of it and see if he 'd be ok asthma-wise - not bec . we wanted to experiment with his pdd symptoms . I did n't want to jump to conclusions so I thought to myself , he did have a cold for the past week and I reduced his dairy intake , maybe it 's that . And then I thought no , he 's had pudding , cheese , a bit of yogurt here and there , so that 's not it . ( And I know that you have to go cold turkey for anyone sensitive to dairy to see any results - we tried the GFCF diet , did n't work for him . ) And who knows , maybe this is temporary progress ( I hope not ! ! ) . After all it 's only been about 2 wks . I 'd love to hear anyone 's opinion on this . Any similar experiences ?
