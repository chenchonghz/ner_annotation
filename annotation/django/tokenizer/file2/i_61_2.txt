Dear Dr. : Daniel 's treatment is done thru his Dan Dr . I have not done the detox think cause toxins are everywhere . You ca n't avoid them all either . I know a lady who did chealation and her sone still is way behind at 14 . He is now on anti inflammitory/anitvirus stuff and finally better . They even tried him takeing cow stem cells to replace his . Digestive enzymes first/probiotics . Then anything else . Both of these help the gut out . I also have learned a acid gut ia bad and leads to cancer . Drink apple cider vinegar our health food owner told me it makes the gut alkaline .
