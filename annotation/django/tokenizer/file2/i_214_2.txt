Increasing Age and Other Factors Reduce the Body & # 146 ; s Production and Utilization of GSH . Research has shown that individuals who have low levels of glutathione are susceptible to chronic illness . Research shows that GSH levels decline by 8 % to 12 % per decade , beginning at the age of 20 . Levels of glutathione are further reduced by continual stress upon the immune system such as illness , infection , and environmental toxins . As we now know , a lowered immune system can bring about illness and disease . This is a ferocious cycle . While you need glutathione for a productive immune system , a weakened immune system hampers the production of glutathione . Supplements Containing Glutathione Alone Will NOT Increase The Body & # 146 ; s GSH Levels . It is pointless to purchase supplements that merely contain glutathione , because the digestive system breaks down ingested glutathione and it will not be absorbed into your system . On the other hand , there is a product that provides the proper nutrients needed to promote the body 's own ability to manufacture and absorb glutathione . It also aids in liver support by destroying environmental poisons helping the liver to function as the main production site and storehouse for glutathione . www.multiuse.info http : //www.evitamins.com/healthnotes.asp ?
