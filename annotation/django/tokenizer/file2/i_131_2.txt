Took J to a new psychiatrist who said that the Concerta he was given in 4th grade has probably been contributing to J 's social withdrawal and anxiety . And all this time , I thought was just autism ! We are taking him off Concerta and the Dr. suggested a few different other medications such as oxytocin and prozac to increase social bonding . Has anyone 's kid gone off Concerta ? How did it go ? Does anyone have experience with either of the other two meds ? - Jane G-W Mom of a charming , wonderful 15 year old son with PDD-NOS and auditory processing issues . We have come a long way !
