We started 10mg prozac 7 days ago and were told that changes would be slight and around the two week mark . It is strictly for anxiety . We saw significant changes at day 2 . Ds is much more engaged and has more social play , no more 'I ca n't take it ' and shutting or melting down . I was and am still not at all excited about having my kid on psychiatric meds but it has been a huge quality of life improvement for him . His therapist says that he can finally focus on working on biofeedback with her and he is spending a lot more time in mainstream instead of melting down and being sent to the resource room to calm . I have a friend with an AS kid who did not respond to prozac ( only became more impulsive on it ) and he has been doing well on Risperdal.- micki , mom to three wonderful and wild kids . ds 10 asperger & anxiety twin dds 6 quirky but NT this far
