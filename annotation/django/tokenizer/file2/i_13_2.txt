Anyone know anything about Culter protocol ? i have been reading about Andy Cutler 's protocol , he seems to make a lot of sense to me . he says the preferred test for mercury is the hair test and that one needs to use the counting method to get indication about levels of mercury and that the std . tests may not be accurate since heavy metal toxicity prevents people 's systems from removing metals and minerals properly . also the part of his protocol that seems tomake sense to me is the low but frequent dose that maintains dmsa and ala in the system for long stretches of time so that the metals can be removed rather than be re distributed which is what may happen with a start and stop ( high / infrequent dose schedule ) . i have no idea about this stuff other than what i have read over the last couple of days and i may have some mis understanding of the details . this seems like an important topic , can be dangerous if done the wrong way and may be very useful if done properly . anyone have any comments on this ? ? ? -dee
