Hopefully your son is under the care of a respected DAN doctor that will advise you on what to do ... Ours was very well known and still is so we did pretty much what he told us too with the exception of IV chelation and B12 shots ... .I just couldnt put her through that it at the time . We did the homeopathic stuff and GFCF diet..and nystatin for yeast..nothing that would harm her~the other stuff was a little scary to me . Did you do a full metabolic profile ? That is what we did..it was very complicated chunk of information came on her and she had so many things that were normal and alot not normal..it was hard to decipher ! Our doctor was wonderful explaining it to us . The things we did had a positive effect on her I am sure of it but cant absolutely prove it since we did ABA & amp ; ST at the same time . I would still do what we did exactly the same : ) Good luck ! - Sarah~8 yrs . old 7/27/00 Pdd/hyperlexia Stephanie~17 ( nt )
