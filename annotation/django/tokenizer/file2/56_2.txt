I would also look at how the demands are placed in school. I would also see the reinforcement schedule. If you little guy is not reinforced for being compliant, he may act out as he will be reinforced for that. Does he have any impulse control issues? You really need to look at how the class is run to know for sure why your son is acting out. Does it move too slow? I also think an FBA with a good BIP in place at school is key. - Mom to ds age 17/nt   dd age 14/nt   ds age 6/asd
