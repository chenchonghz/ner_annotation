I think there are just too many thoughtless people out there . I always arrange for someone to watch my son while I talk to his teacher , have IEP meetings , ect so that he does n't hear anything being said about him . I constantly have to tell strangers not to touch him , he is amazingly cute but I do n't think that is why they do it , and having weirdos touch him is very upsetting for him . It 's so stupid , it 's like telling someone who is freaking out to `` just relax '' seriously that is the last thing you want to hear when you are upset . Patting someone on the head is the most condescending thing you can do to someone , it is so insulting ! Seriously , why ca n't people keep their hands to themselves . I remember when I was pregnant , people would always touch my belly , not just co-workers , even perfect strangers . One day I went on a home visit , since I was pregnant I always took another officer with me , well , that day I did a surprise visit on an alcoholic gang banger and he reached out to touch my belly as he was asking me what I was having , and the officer with me slammed him to the ground and cuffed him . He was my favorite co-worker after that !
