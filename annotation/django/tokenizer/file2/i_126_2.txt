I would personally stick to rotating the motrin and tylenol if it is going to keep his fevers in check and keep him out of the hospital . ( which is what they will give if you take him into the hospital with a fever ) . My kids get Motrin and Tylenol only if they are running a fever 101.0 or above . We usually do the lukewarm bath , the cool rag on the forehead , and letting them run around naked as well when they have a fever because it tends to bring it down . It seems odd they do n't want you using the tylenol . - Courage is being scared to death - and saddling up anyway ! -John Wayne Mom to two beautiful boys with ASD ages six and nine
