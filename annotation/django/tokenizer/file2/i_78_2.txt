This school is being VERY incompetent in dealing with his diabetes ! Today he couldnt take his insulin because when he went to go take it at the nurses office it was frozen solid ! So he didnt get his insulin till 2 hours later and this isnt the first time . The first time was a few days after he first went to school he got his lunch tray and went to the nurses office as was layed out for him to do and the nurses office was locked . He ended up eating and not taking his insulin that day cuz he didnt know what to do . He should have went to the office but he said he didnt think about that . The day before yesterday we met with them and my mother in law requested the care plan the nurse said shed give to her and they told mikey to ask the nurse for it but they didnt even know what we were talking about ( and the vice principal- who was there when we went over the plan of action on dealing with taking his insulin- was playing clueless too ) . And now today his insulin was frozen , do they not realize this is serious ? Anyway im pissed ! Micki , i know where ur coming from but still its a scary situation to be in not knowing what cards they are trying to play .
