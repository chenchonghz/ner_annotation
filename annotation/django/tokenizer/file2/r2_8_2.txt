Welcome Paulos . I am sure you will find much support here . I 'm sorry you are going through such a rough time . Alcohol is a depressant , and it also robs your body of the ability to absorb necessary nutrients-like B vitamins which help immensely with mood disorders and anxiety . Also excessive alcohol use alone can create or contribute to depression , anxiety , and OCD issues . Since you are on meds , it would probably be best to consult a doctor to help you with alcohol withdrawal and balancing your medication . That is the best way . Memory loss is associated with autism/asperger 's , but yours sounds pretty extreme and will probably improve with your general health when you sober up . No one can be properly diagnosed until the substance abuse problem is addressed-then a doctor can help you find ways to manage the underlying issues that you are self-medicating with alcohol . There IS a lot of help and compassion for you out there when you are ready to ask . Good Luck !
