My suggestion is to stop ALA . These type of issues have happened in many children who can not handle ALA as their chelator . The side effects can last for months after it is stopped . Not sure if he is still doing ALA but I think I remembered him doing it at one point . I 'm all about getting out heavy metals and the biomedical approach but ALA was an issue for us , myself included when I took it , and several people I know who have used it either with themselves or their children on the `` proper '' protocols . Just my opinion . And he may not even be using it but I have n't been on his blog in ages and ages to read what all is going on in his life . Hmm now that I 'm thinking about it I am remembering that there was more self injurious behaviors before sasha started on Trileptal and had his EEG 's . When we realized that he was having seizures and started treating it those behaviors decreased tremendously . At this point in time he is n't doing anything self injurious . His broken arm came from standing on an exercise ball and little brother kicking it out from under him , from what I gathered from the two . Just boy stuff we 're dealing with now . I hope that JB is able to get some answers . Sounds like he may need to stop everything he is doing and re evaluate what he needs to continue doing and start getting some neuro test or GI tests done . GI issues that are painful can cause these issues too . It could be anything . _________________ http : //i61.photobucket.com/albums/h44/sashasrecovery/AutismRibon.gif
