Just need to chime in here and let you know that I was medicated for ADHD with dexadrine and my dose was 5mg and I am an adult . That dose until I got used to it knocked my socks off ! ! ! The drug dexadrine has another name and it is dextroamphedamine . I have taken other stimulants but this one BY FAR was the strongest . This particular drug was also a well known abused speed in the 60 's and 70 's . THey used to prescribe it for weight loss and stopped using it as such because of not only the addictive properties but the severe weight loss . Ever heard of `` pink hearts ? '' This is NOT a drug I would want my child on . THere are other stimulants that are not nearly as strong , or have as many nasty side effects .
