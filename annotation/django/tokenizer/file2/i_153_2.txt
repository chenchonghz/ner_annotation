Hi guys , This post is about zinc supplements . My son has had severe tantrum issues and speech delay . We went to our `` autism specialist '' ( she is the best in the area ) and she had my son get his blood drawn . From this we found out that he has an elevated copper to zinc ratio . She suggested that we have him take a zinc/vitamic c compounded supplement . I was skeptical at first , but his therapists nagged me so I found someone who can compound the medicine and we started to half heartedly give it to him ( probably average once a day out of two they suggested ) . Over time , we began to notice that his behavior was improving . On the days we did n't give it to him at all , we noticed the next day his behavior was crummy . So , still not quite believing but hopeful , I started to give it to him twice every day as prescribed . His behavior is still not `` normal '' , but is so much better that I still ca n't believe it . He is close to normal now and I am very very hopeful . We can shop again and do some things as a family again . Has anyone else had success with zinc ? I just still ca n't believe it would be this simple . I am waiting for the other shoe to drop if you know what I mean ? Please let me know if anyone has had experiences with zinc . Thanks guys !
