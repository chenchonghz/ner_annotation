Why all doctors do n't do it as a matter of course when diagnosing with Autism is beyond me.Test for mercury and selenium . Kids with merc will show EXTREMELY low levels , like .000001 % . This means they are retaining mercury . Their selenium levels will also be VERY low , if non-existent . Selenium is what produces Glutathione in the body , which naturally chelates mercury . No surprise there is a deficiency of selenium in just about every child who received thimerosal and has autism . Yes folks , it IS that cut and dry.My theory is that a child 's place on the spectrum can be directly correlated to their deficiency in selenium . That will not prove to be true for many years . Wan na know why ? I 'm surprised nobody really thinks about this , but I do.The statute of limitations to sue a pharm company over a drug or vaccine is 3 years . In 2003 , they removed thimerosal from child vaccines , for no immediate reason . Plans are in the works to remove it from all vaccines over the next few years . I 'm really not guessing , because I 'm pretty damn sure in my mind , but 3+ years after that everything will come out in the wash. Until then , do n't expect to see anything from the CDC but `` everything is fine , all is well , go get another shot '' . File suit now if you 're within 3 years.Those of you that are old enough probably remember these words , those that are n't , ask your parents ... ... ... .. '' Cigarette smoking DOES NOT cause cancer '' If thats not a lesson to question everything you read and hear , I do n't know what is .
