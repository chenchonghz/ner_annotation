Hi..first ( ( ( hugs ) ) ) ) we have had to cut back big time , due to finances and costs of living just being so high . I know it is hard for you . My kids are under the same constraints and it has been hard . We try to do more at home together with free movies on demand , games , chatting . Can your parents do that ? Also , we do a lot of home cooking-make donuts with just flour-made dough , fry it up and put sugar or choc syrup on them , maple flavored syrup etc . Can that be done at your family ? Also , if you have a library card , you can rent moves for free , as well as get some cd 's to listen to . As for smell , yes , we have that here with my kids because of incontinence issues . What I do is , I buy body spray for boys , and fds for Taylor . I spray it on the pads that they wear , and on them also . It acts like a deodorant . Also , putting corn starch on your underwear helps absorb any odor . I make my own wipes as well-baby wash soap , baby oil , water and cut-in-half bounty paper towels . They wipe with those and it gives a nice smell . We are close to financial ruin but , we are trying everything we can to keep ourselves together and as a family . I do understand how hard it is . If you have IM and ever want to talk to any of my kids on there , they would love that . Just leave me a message and I will give them your id-they would love to share with you and give you a shoulder to lean on . - Colin/Taylor ASD , Molly , Sean ( SD ) /Ryan
