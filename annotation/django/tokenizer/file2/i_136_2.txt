Well , I know that for the vitamin B-12 it can have a bigger impact on speech if given as a shot . I ca n't remember the terminology , subcutaneous ? ? ? But I give my son a Methyl B-12 shot but he is only two and has not talked yet . I have a family member who is a nurse at a hospital and she said that they give that to patients who have Alzheimer 's and she said that on the days they get it they seem to remember more . Also , remember to add cod liver or some type of omega fatty acids . I was also researching autism and I came across a study that said their was a correlation between having to much serotonin in our blood when you are autistic and not speaking . I am thinking of having my sons blood tested to see how high his serotonin levels are . - Sonia Mom to Manny , Aedan and Araceli
