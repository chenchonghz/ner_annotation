I 've had my daughter on TMG for about a week now . She 's doing really good ( making more sounds , more aware of surroundings ) , alittle more hyper . Do I have to give a form of folate for the Tmg be absorbed right ? I have given her folic , folinic , and folapro , on each one she became so hyper she had to be restrained and we had to cancel her therapies . I am giving her carnosine with the Tmg , will that help ? Also , about 3 days ago she started having diarrhea with lots of mucus in it . Can this be yeast ? ( I heard TMG ups yeast ) . I only give her one probiotic a day . Should I give her two ? Sorry about so many questions , I 'm just confused about what to do now . Thanks for any help ! !
