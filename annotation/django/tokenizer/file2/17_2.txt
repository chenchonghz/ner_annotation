The form of chelation which was being used in this unfortunate case was EDTA in IV form, which carries a higher risk to the patient than oral DMSA or DMPS. All forms are fully licensed by the FDA for us to reduce elevated metals, most notably lead and mercury. There is also the question of whether it was an IV drip or "push". The use of IV EDTA for arterial clog reduction is unproven and unlicensed. Drs. have gotten into trouble for using it for that purpose. There are still many questions to be answered in this tragic case before judgement can be made. It may turn out to be a case of expected adverse risk. It may be a case of malpractice. Time will tell. I do expect the antio-chelation people to use this to clamour for a complete cessation of an otherwise necessary proceedure. People with elevated metals need to be able to remove them to reduce the longterm effects they can have on body and mind.
