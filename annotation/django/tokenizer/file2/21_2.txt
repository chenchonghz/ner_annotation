Well, I did herbal chelation on two of my children with good results but I really recommend antiviral and diet treatment foremost. I think slow chelation, like with epsom salt and Vitamin C are much less worrisome. I am definitely not against stronger chelation, because it does help, but I doing the slower chelation methods now and it is working.
