Anyone who has used Mb-12 injections , was your child a responder and how did you know ? About how long before you saw results ? We 're 2 weeks into them and I 'm just not sure I 'm seeing anything . I thought that if they were going to respond , you 'd be able to see quickly . We did rotate from Nystatin to GSE during this timeframe and DS has had `` flu-like '' and perhaps die-off symptoms . So , maybe that 's why I ca n't tell . He is trying to wave now ( just not appropriately ) .
