I have avoided Tylenol for 2 1/2 years since one of the first times I came to the board that study was mentioned . I gave ds probably way too much Tylenol when he was a toddler - for teething . We switched to Motrin for both kids and my dd has almost never had it as a result . To me , it 's one of those things where it has n't been proven - but I just do n't want to take that chance . I do n't give either of the kids Motrin very much either - but if they have a high fever or ear infection ( for my dd ) I will . We have been doing more Vicks VapoRub and buckwheat honey for coughs/sore throats/congestion . It seems to be working fairly well so far . Just my opinion , but I 'm of the camp where if you can find something else to use that does n't have any issues raised about it - then I go for the alternative . I just do n't want to take a chance , even if it 's not proven . - DS ( 9 yo ) diagnosed with mild PDD-NOS and DD ( 6 yo ) NT - but definitely a challenge !
