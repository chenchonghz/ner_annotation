My son , Sean , who has ADHD and is being tested for autism , has been on Concerta for 3 years . He is 12 now . When he started taking medication , he started with Strattera and it did n't work . Then we switched him to Adderral and it seemed to work for a while . We took him off of it because he lost 20 pounds at the age of 8-9 years old . He was also itching his nose and had dark circles under his eyes . They said the itching was from the medication- when it was wearing off . Now- the Concerta seems to be working a little . He can focus more than he could before . And now that his body is getting `` used '' to it- he is gaining weight little by little . We do have to keep upping the dose though . It is so tricky with drugs . Oh ya- and if he takes it past 6 am- he is up all night- like until 2 or 3 am . On a side note- but totally relevant- my autistic son , Eric , had his 3 year testing done and we had the meeting for it today . They were talking about how he does n't have the ability to stay focused and he is impulsive . It sounded exactly why we put Sean on meds . So we will be discussing it with the Drs and start the process of finding the right meds for him too- I think . Best wishes to you and take care .
