HI I am also late dx'ed . It was dx'ed by a local dr. that specializes , but seeking a second opinion : I had some problems as a baby- thumoing head , lack of attchemnt , etc . Then at 13 , it hit full force , but it seems that that is not typical . I could not eat , got the dx of anorexia , and have been disabled ever since . They only looked at that part of it , when there were many other issues- major sense problems , rigid schedule , etc . I do think I may indeed have AS . But i am not sure why this hit at 13 and not 2 or so . Has anyone else had a late onset ? Also , could it be something else ? I also had the MMR booster shot at the time , but I also had STREP at that time which is linked to PANDAS . Iam confused . I amalso worried after b9st8 's post that he lost SSDI ? I am on dis . now for anorexia and ptsd . If these are secondary to AS , could I have to start all over ? Confused . Not sure I want a 2nd opinion now . Sorenna
