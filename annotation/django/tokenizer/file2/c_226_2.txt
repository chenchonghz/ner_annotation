Risperidone is typically used for aggression . I take Geodon for ... sort of anxiety , frustration , outbursts , melt downs . It helps with all of the above . Clearly the medication Marella tried when she was younger was n't the right one . That has no bearing on other medications , though . I had a bad reaction to Celexa ( I actually developed full-blown Tourette 's syndrome on it ) . I gained a lot of weight on Paxil . But I do fine on other SSRIs ( Prozac , Zoloft ) . You just have to be careful and work with a really GOOD doctor . I use a medication similar to Ativan ( called Klonopin ) for emergencies . Meaning , if I feel a melt down or a panic attack coming on , I take it , and it takes the edge off . It makes it so I can use strategies I 've learned to calm myself down . Without the meds , I ca n't think straight enough to think of any strategies.- Lydia ... ASD and the whole alphabet and then some . 23 , love my ( service ) cat www.autisticspeaks.wordpress.com
