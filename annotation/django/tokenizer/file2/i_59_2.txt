I 'm not sure to whom you are referring , but I am not an old lady with a law degree , and I did not state what you quoted above . Name-calling is not an effective method to make a point or discuss facts regarding a treatment - neither are boasts you have made elsewhere on this forum that your child `` functions better than any kids I have seen who has an ASD diagnosis '' while promoting treatments . I think when you make such statements you should probably expect questions . Back to the topic of the thread : sashasmom wrote : It says that they are on MEDICATION chelators in addition to the clay baths . You can cleary see that from their statements . Yes , so it would therefore be impossible to evaluate the chelating effect of the clay bath . I also might mention that there is a difference in the type of test administered for acute lead poisoning and those typically sent to a few select labs after administration of a chelator . The labs promoted heavily on sites for autism typically use `` provoked '' samples ( samples taken after administration of a chelator ) and compare these to unprovoked norms ( samples where no chelator was administered ) . This raises many questions of validity regarding these `` provoked '' tests . Parents who are interested in the chelation of lead might be interested in the following study in Pediatrics : Effect of Chelation Therapy on the Neuropsychological and Behavioral Development of Lead-Exposed Children After School Entry http : //pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/114/1 /19 Many articles regarding lead poisoning can be searched on sites such as PubMed . - Heffalump
