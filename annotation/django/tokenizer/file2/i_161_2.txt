My son 's Dr perscribes Super Nu Thera P5P 3 times a day . I notice there are 50 mg of vitamin B6 in each one , so that would be 150mg of vitamin B6 a day . I read online it should be 100 mg to 600 mg per day . If 150 a day does n't help , is it safe to go up ? and how long should I wait to see if it helps ? How much do you give your child ? My son is 12 and around 100 lbs .
