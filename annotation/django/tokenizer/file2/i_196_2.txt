1 . Not sure . 2 . You probably want to get a liquid calcium . We do a liquid calcium/magnesium . 3 . We use Polyvisol because my son wont chew chewable vitamins . I liked one called Dr. Green , though , from Twin Labs and it 's all organic . 4 . Glycine is an amino acid . I could be wrong here , but my understanding is that dimethylglycine and trimethylglycine serve as protein support ( brain development ) and aid in the methylation of cells . 5 . Selenium has some relaionship with glutathione , which our kids are often lacking . 6 . CoQ10 will help detoxify . L-taurine is an amino acid . 7 . I think you should test for zinc first . I think zinc might be one of the things you can overdo if you 're not careful . 8 . I do n't know if theres a blood test . You might want to ask your doctor on that one . We are seeing our DAN for the first time in a couple weeks . I am going to write down all my kazillion questions .
