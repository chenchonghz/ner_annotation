Cam we are in the same state you are in - i was 100 % sure that he ( R ) did not have heavy metals -he had some regression but it was not huge - specifically he was always engaged with us - but after the porphyrin tests came back really high in Mercury ( his was 23 - normal is 5-9 ) and the words were written on the paper - `` Remarkable mercury toxicity on the body '' I can no longer not look at the biomed stuff We are meeting with a DAN doctor- he is a regular MD and is also interested in DAN - one thing that impressed me is that he told me to read the book - and only make an appointment if that made sense to me so I read the book `` CHanging the course of Autism '' - one of the most sceintific books I 've read on Autism so far and it DID made sense to me One of the big things they beleive in is MB 12 shots and they beleive most kids with ASD should try the Mb12 shots for a few weeks and he has already send the prescription to a Pharma who in turn - mailed in the Mb12 shots - they are not that expensive - a months supply with refrigerated shipping is 36 bucks - what a chilll they are striking in my heart everytime I open the refrigerator - Still I know that I need to conquer my fear as maybe R really needs it . I will updare you all on the biomed journey - I am such a skeptic but if it works I want alll the ASD members to know about it We have already been in intervention for a year and R is continuing to make steady progress but its slow Also wanted to add that we did GF CF for 3 months very strictly and saw no change at all - no regression no progression - so we quit on it- Plus R never had any gut issues apart from when on antibiotics - so I have thought the biomed would not work for us ( not that it does not work for many kids who took the biological road into Autism and therefore the biological solution will work to come out of it ) Edited by KajoliT on April 21 2008 at 4:42am- Mom to R , 4 year old ASD
