My son took strattera for a while and it did not help as much with the focus ( as compared to the stimulant medications ) he also seemed to have more trouble with transitions and was crabby . He takes vyvance now and this by far is the best for him ... .this is in the stimulant group similar to adderall but it has a smoother onset . Also , his appetite is not as effected . If the strattera is working than stick with it , just keep you eye out for side effects .
