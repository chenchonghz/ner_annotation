OK , finally got the tests . If anyone could comment on some of these numbers I would really appreciate it . BUN/CREATININE Ratio was 44 ( 15/.34 ) - this is like twice as high as it needs right ? Blood work for metals were pretty much all in range ( zinc and calcium was slightly low ) , and blood for toxic elements ( Arsenic , Cadmium , Lead , Mercury , thallium ) were all in nomal range . They took hair samples to run for toxics we get back in a month or so . The only Moderate food sensitivity he had was for eggs , which he never eats anyway . Most were Not Significant , about 15 were in the Low range . IgG Casein and Gluten were both in the Low range . Can someone just tell me what this urine test was ? I know all these values are high . Here are the results : Epinephrine 24.2Norepinephrine 167.1 Dopamine & nbs p ; 284.3 Serotonin & nb sp ; 281.8 GABA & n bsp ; 4.1 Glutamate & nb sp ; 88.5 PEA & nb sp ; 127.4 Histamine & nb sp ; 27.5 Creatinine & n bsp ; 48.7 I really appreciate anyone who can shed some light on this for me.ThanksJason
