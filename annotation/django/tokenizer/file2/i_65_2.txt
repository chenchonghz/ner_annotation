Adderall calms me . I have energy but I 'm centered . SLP Mom , I did see something though about adderall and children with heart abnormalities . What 's worrisome is that heart abnormalties can be undetected . I would definitely check that out about adderall and the heart , it was on some Canadian website I found . I think there was a recall or safety alert in Canada about it .
