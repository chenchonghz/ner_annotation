Hello all ! I have been working with a few parents of ASD children . The current look into oral chelation took me to look at liquid zeolites . After I had seen a bit of the research , I found they are completely safe , unlike EDTA or DMPS . The liquid zeolites have been proven to not take out any calcium , magnesium or any other beneficial minerals , having only an affinity for the detrimental heavy metals . Since much of the ASD patients seem to have a connection with Thimerasol and mercury poisoning I figured that it would be worth looking into . The preliminary results have been incredibly promising and it is even more effective ( in my humble opinion ) than the IV chelation because the child does not even have to know they are taking the chelating elements ! If anyone wants more information , please email me so that I can send you some more information ! Sincerely , Sean
