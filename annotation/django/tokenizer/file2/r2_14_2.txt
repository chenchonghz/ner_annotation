Hello , Just a quick introduction as I am a newbie to the forum . I am 27 & amp ; have aspergers . I was diagnosed late in my life compared to others on the spectrum . I always had a feeling that I was different than others and it was a relief to finally have an answer . Oddly enough I accidently fell into the field of ABA during my early years in college and have been working in the field ever since as Bx Asst . working mainly in early intervention programs for children with autism . Though I do have a difficult time relating to others I can understand what these children are going through even with my own social deficits which has turned out to be quite beneficial . I have many questions and I hope that I am accepted here so I can receive the support from others . Thanks for caring - Kimberly ~ Aspergers
