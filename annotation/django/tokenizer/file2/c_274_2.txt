Low Dose Naltrexone ( LDN ) , which is an opioid antagonist , is also another one to research . There are a few published studies on LDN and autism as well with efficacy seen with respect to reduction in certain behaviours ( specifically self-injurious behaviour ) . Here is an autism case study that used risperidone which lost efficacy after five months , then switched to couple of mood stabilizers with no efficacy , and finally tried Low Dose Naltrexone which worked . One can get it transdermal form to bypass GI side-effects and there are a number of parents here who have tried it . We have n't tried this yet as do n't have any severe behaviour concerns but researching this at the moment . http : //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19393386
