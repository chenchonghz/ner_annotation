Have you tried requesting some ABA in the classroom ... a specialist comes in and works with the child on learning skills ... . My 13 yr old has always struggled with doing his work independently , but after struggling for years with this issue ... .he just needs special assistance to get his work done ! ! ! During an IEP , requesting a aide would be a great idea ... Do you have an advocate ? ? ? ? They are a great help in getting the school district to meet you child 's needs ... . How does the melatonin work during the day ? I 'm curious , I give it to my son at bedtime to sleep , his pediatrician recommended it . He takes 2 mg , he has so much anxiety and it used to take him 3 to 4 hours to fall asleep , now its less than 1 hour . I did n't even know you could take it during the day . My little guy is very anxious and hyper , I am curious as to how it works for your child , if you do n't mind sharing .
