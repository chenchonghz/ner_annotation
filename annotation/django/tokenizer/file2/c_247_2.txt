Hi Karen , yes , definitely Keppra will make you feel different until you get used to it . All anticonvulsants are pretty heavy duty drugs , even the newer ones . For me it was a little different because I was coming off one drug ( carbatrol ) and going on Keppra and is a long process to switch drugs . I had already been on anticonvlusants for years before going on Keppra . I am assuming this is your first anticonvulsant ? It could take anywhere from 2-8 weeks to get used to the drug , with 4 weeks being the most likely amount . I actually got a little manic on it when I first went on ( lots of energy , could n't sleep , felt a little TOO good ) . Found out later from my doctor that is a known , though rare , side effect . It did n't last more than a month or so . More common side effects would be nausea and fatigue . When you first go on ANY drug , you can feel quite crappy so give it a few weeks . Side effects should not last more than a month or 2 or it might not be the right drug for you . Unfortunately with seizures there is a lot of trial and error with drugs . Overall , I felt much better on keppra and it 's my favorite of the anticonvulsants I was on . THe other drugs made me tired and in a fog . WIth Keppra I had my energy . The doctor ( I am assuming it 's a neurologist ? ) will keep a close eye on you and have you come back every 3 or 6 months . HOpe this helps . YOu can always PM if you have any more questions or want to talk about seizures or meds . It can be quite a difficult thing to deal with - especially on top of everything else ! - Not all who wander are lost . J.R.R . Tolkien
