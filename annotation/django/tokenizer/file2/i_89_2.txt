Kyle was put on zoloft in December for the morning crazyness that was totally out of control . It help SOOO much I ca n't tell you . The school on the other hand insisted that the zoloft was causing him suidial thoughts and bad behaviors . The school pycoloist and nurse insisted that I take him off the zoloft and I refused . Their conclusion was that his issues was caused by `` Poor Parenting Skills '' . so since January they have called Kyles doctor and everything to try and get me to take him off the zoloft and I still refused and the doctor backed my up on it . ( I `` DID '' authorize them to talk to the doctors ) Recently I made an appointment for him to be evaluated by Kennedy Kreager and I 'm trying to eliminate as much medication as possible before the evaluation so they can get a clear picture of what 's going on . I weaned him off the zoloft and WOW ... he is a total nut case now . This morning was the first morning that the zoloft is obviously totally out of his system and he is climing the walls can throwing things , threatening to kill the dog etc . SOOO ... I called the special ed teacher at school and gav eher a heads up that he 's off the wall and reminded her that the pycologist and nurse both insisted he be off the medication and advised her that she should call the pycologist and take him to the nurse and ask them if they have any better ideas . Hopefully they 'll get the point this time- It 's Me ... Terri
