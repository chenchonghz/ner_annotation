My 7 yr old has severe apraxia and it is sooo hard for him to speak ... .he does well with his pictures ... which is a plus ... he has improved so much with following directions and he has grown so much through this process ... During chelation days , I give him 3mg of melatonin 3x/day ( he is very hyper ) ... but he pees so good on chelation days ... otherwise he struggles to release the urine ( suspect metals in his urinary track ) ... he sleeps well and is happy ... .but in the early days of this process ... .I noticed that his system was very tight from the metals moving ... .manipulation has been a god send ! ! ! ! Does your dr order metals test every 3rd round ? ? ..this is what my dan does and everything seems to be going well ! ! ! My son takes 200mg of DMSA 3x/day for 3 days as well as 50 mg of ALA , then we use essential oils that help to pull more metals for 4 days after DMSA as well as an ionic mineral blend , then 5 days of lots of enzymes , and 2 doses of multi 's on all days without DMSA ... . I also increase his Nystatin by a few scoops and that helps to keep the yeast under control ... .Do you have a yeast protocol ? ? ? - Mom to 14 yr old boy ( Aspie , ADHD/OCD/ODD/RAD/Seizures ) and 7 yr old boy ( ASD - possibly PDD )
