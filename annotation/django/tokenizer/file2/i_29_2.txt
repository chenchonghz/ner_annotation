Hi Lesley Nick had high levels of antimony , arsenic , cadmiuim , thallium , tin and elevated levels of lead . Most of these were triple the normal range . A couple of them were double/ He also had high levels o fchromium , molbdenum , boron , sulfur and vanadium . I do n't even know what some of these are . The only thing the dr said was he could have been exposed in everyday life.. Duh ! She did n't give any examples , but I checked out that website you gave and water seems to be a consistent factor . Who knows ? ? ? ! ! ! As far as her experience , well she has only chelated `` about a half dozen . '' I know that she has attended many DAN conferences .She will be chelating orally . Suppposedly it is not as dangerous , but the side effects are the same either way . What I want to know is what will happen if I do n't decide to put him through this ... ... ..- Mommy of a 2yo autistic son named Nick and 2 girls named Kaity 11 and Lizzie 3 .
