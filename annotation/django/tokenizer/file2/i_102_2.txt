I 'm wondering if anyone has their small children on prozac ? I 'm really scared to medicate my son . Our developmental ped suggested either tenex or a really low dose of prozac for his anxiety/ocd type behaviors . He is only 5 and I 'm afraid of both drugs . The tenex scares me because they need to monitor his blood pressure . I would n't think of trying either one but we have n't slept much latey and Drew 's meltdowns and list of obsessions are getting worse lately . ( He does occasionally have a good week or two ) Please let me know if you 've had any luck with either of these drugs . Thanks , Laurie- mom of Drew -age 5 PDD-NOS & Nicky age 3 -NT ? or poss PDD-NOS ?
