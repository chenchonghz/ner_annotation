In some cases , you may want to dump the easy to chelate metals out of the body as fast as you can . Else the slow method will end up moving the metals to the brain - One reason why DMPS blows the doors off DMSA in intitial effect . DMPS does n't cross BBB , and its got a narrower pull of metals and its got strong affinity for those metals . And it will clean out so fast that your body all of a sudden can function much better . Then it begins the slow transportation of metals out of the brain . So in some cases DMPS is much much safer than DMSA .
