Hi , Let me first wish you a Happy and Prosperous New Year 2008 ! ! ! ! ! I am father of a sweet and cute three years old son , who is diagnosed as PDD NOS when he was 26 months old . I am in Pleasant hill . My son is bright in some areas and very poor in some areas like , he can recognize all alphabets ( capital and small ) and can count from 1-20 , knows all body parts , can recognize almost all colors , knows all objects around him and very much alert about his surroundings and also very affectionate . However , he has least attention span and hardly do eye contact with us , avoid crowds ( not social at all ) and always like to be in his own world . He will say the name of objects , only if you ask him and also not really understand many things that we say him . He is very much visual , can spend hours with books and watching cartoons in TV . He was under ABA program through Regional center of east bay till last week and from next week , he will go to school for special education . Now we are seriously thinking about bio-medical treatment . We have started GFCF diet for him since last one and half months and want to go to a DAN Doctor . I was thinking about Dr. THAUNA ABRIN ( as I want to start both homeopathy and bio-medical at same time and she is a Naturopathic Doctor and a DAN and also closure to us i.e . in Walnut creek ) . I was wondering , whether you can help us on all these . Any advise on this regard will help us a lot . Please guide us , how to proceed ahead . Regards ,
