Curious , my son was on Zithromax and I know it stays in your system for 14 days even though you only take it for 5 . He is on the tail end of the 14 days period and his stools are loose and foul smelling , i was wondering if this could be a yeast die off from the antibiotic ? anyone had similar experiences when your kids were on meds . He is also on MB12 injections but the doc said this was not a side effect from that so its more than likely a result of the antibiotic but I was wondering if any one else had this happen as well . Thanks ! i know he does n't have a viral thing because he is fine in every other aspect just this one and loose stools are not a problem for him.- juls35inva mom to A ( 5 ) PDD , J ( 14 ) ADHD `` AUTISM IS NOT A DISABILITY , ITS A DIFFERENT WAY OF BEING ''
