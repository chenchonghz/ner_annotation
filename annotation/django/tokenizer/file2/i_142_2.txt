The whole thing is ridiculous . If you can prove immunity they should not be able to force you to give another virus.I know you live in a small town , but I agree get a different doctor . Or move ! Is n't that something how this doctor does n't question Miralax or injecting live viruses into a child , but questions using magnesium citrate for constipation ! As long as your child has 2X the calcium as magnesium this is by far the safest option .
