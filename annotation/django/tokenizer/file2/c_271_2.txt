dad75- you might want to consider getting a Comprehensive Methylation Panel with Methylation Pathway Analysis test from Dr. Amy Yasko if your daughter reacts to multivitamins . That 's a key piece of information right there . The test is a one time genetic test . You do n't need to keep repeating it like a yeast or bacteria test . Dr. Yasko does n't do whole DNA sequencing , but she provides info on certain key mutations your child might have once you send in the blood sample . You have to pay out of pocket ( less than $ 500 ) but it 's totally worth it . It 's been one of the most significant tests we 've done and we 've done a lot of tests ! We did ours about two years ago and some of the supplements we needed based on the genetics were things we were already doing because we could see they worked so well for our child . So it was nice to have that confirmation . Language severity depends of dopamine , glutamate/gaba and methylation . The lower the dopamine levels , the more of an impact on speech . Of course you do n't want dopamine too high because then you have mood swings and it impacts serotonin . Sometimes you could be genetically predisposed to having good dopamine levels , but very high bacteria count can impact the dopamine levels . If you daughter has mutations on her COMT ( catechol-O-methyltransferase ) , VDR or MTHFR A1298C as it impacts BH4 levels , those could impact speech . Then you also have to consider the GABA and glutamate role in speech because GABA/glutamate balance plays a role too .
