Thanks for your updates!! It sounds like you both are getting good great results! I hope that we can find something that will help our little guy start making progress.  I can't say he hasn't made any, he was not even able to walk independently or stand before we started the biomedical approach last October - and he starting standing within 1 month of starting mb12 shots and cod liver oil, he soon was walking back and forth to us and a week before Christmas he walked out of the room - so that has been huge! But nothing as far as language has changed yet and he is still way behind in motor development. - Lynn -  Mom to Dylan   - Just turned 3(Somewhere on the Spectrum)  Doing Biomedical since Oct 07
