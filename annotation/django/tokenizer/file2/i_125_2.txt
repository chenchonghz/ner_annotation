We took our ds to see a DAN doctor in the middle of December . In his report he suggests that ds does n't take Tylenol anymore because a study showed that acetominophen can affect glutahione levels . Now the reason that this concerns me is that he has seizures and when he gets a fever he needs to take Motrin and Tylenol every other 4 hours to keep his temp from rising or falling to fast . Has anyone ever heard of this and do you give your children Tylenol when they are n't feeling well ? - Take care , Paws SAHM to an amazing little boy . ( DS 5 , SID , Devel .
