My son has been on risperdol for about 3 1/2 years and it use to work well but lately the results are not the same . My son is almost 12 and puberty has really kicked our butt ! My son is having severe tics ( that Risperdol use to control ) and is having aggressive behavior . We have a wonderful doctor who specializes in autism . He suggested that we try Zyprexa since we have tried ( years ago ) Serequol and Abilify and we did n't really see any results . I understand that every child is different but I was just wondering if anyone else has had experience with Risperdol losing its effect . Our doctor said this usually happens with other meds like Prozac not Risperdol but everyone is different . Anyway , I 'm hoping we see an improvement with Zyprexa and feedback would be appreciated .
