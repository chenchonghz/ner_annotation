Hello Everyone , I 'm new to your forum , but wanted to offer some new information . Manganese is a trace mineral in the body . The US manganese research council thought that people could not be deficient in this mineral because they did lab testing of animals and found it very hard to achieve . However , they were not feeding these lab animals the American diet of iron enriched wheat and soy everywhere . In a technical book on manganese , it states that iron competes for absorption with manganese , and a diet high in iron , can cause manganese deficiency . Soy , high in phytates , forms insoluble complexes in the intestines and does not let the body absorb manganese . When you become deficient in manganese , you can not properly make the carrier proteins for iron and copper in the liver and/or bind these minerals to them for export into the bloodstream . Without adequate bound iron and copper , SO MANY body functions malfunction . I have done hair mineral analysis for many children . This has shown up repeatedly in children with autism and ADD and ADHD and other behavioral disorders : severe manganese deficiency . Unfortunately , there is not a reliable blood test for this mineral . Only a liver biopsy will confirm this deficiency as far as the medical community is concerned . As far as I 'm concerned , hair mineral testing is very valid and the results speak for themselves !
