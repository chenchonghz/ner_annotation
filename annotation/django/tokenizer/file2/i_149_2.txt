... after MONTHS of stressing , reading , etc . etc . I am now officialy starting the diet . We are going casein free starting yesterday . I am still not ready to committ to the glueten free ... but baby steps right ? ? I am avoiding glueten when possible and trying to make more healthy choices but we are definatley not completely GF and do n't know if we can be ... DS has never been on cows milk but drinks two 8 oz bottles of warm soy milk a day . This is his only real source of protein as he does not want any meat except the little he will get in chicken nuggets . I know I will have to replace his soy milk with rice/almond/or hemp . Do these options have the same high protein levels ? I am also worried about calcium because as of yesterday DS is not going to be getting his daily yogurt drink . Bottom line - what are examples of foods high in protein and calcium that your kids will eat ? ? ***Sorry - just saw answers to very similar questions in posts by Boobah - never mind ... and thanks for the great information ! !
