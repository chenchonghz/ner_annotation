I have heard of quite a few kids on seizure meds and risperdal , and it can be helpful . Zach does have seizures , and we have tried abilify and risperdal . I ca n't remember if he was on depakote when we tried those meds or not . So many drugs have that warning that it may increase the seizure threshold . We tried abilify and risperdal and Zach did not react well to them , or any other behavior med . He gets very restless , is unable to sleep , nausea and vomiting as well as other symptoms . He was miserable , and his behavior was much worse with the meds than without them . In Zach 's case we are no longer attempting any behavior meds , so his neuro is reintroducing depakote for behavior . AED 's can help with behavior , and of course sometimes make them worse . If it was me I 'd try another AED before trying risperdal . Sorry I just noticed you can raise the trileptal . I would start by raising the trileptal if there 's a need due to behavior , before going to risperdal . Since Hayden is only 4 yrs old I would n't be in a hurry to try risperdal . Zachary is 7 yrs old and has severe behaviors , so I completely understand your reasons for trying risperdal . Sometimes no amount of behavior interventions can help . They wo n't even do a FBP for Zach , since they have absolutley no idea what sets him off . We use ativan when Zach goes into major meltdowns , and he 's ' going to hurt himself , or someone else . It works well , and it may be something worth considering , since it 's an AED . Good luck , there are no easy answers when it comes to meds and behaviors .
