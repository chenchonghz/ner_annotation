My son 's eating and bowels problems are severe . First , for the constipation we use miralax daily . You can buy it over the counter or with a prescription . It 's not harmful at all . It just allows the stool to gain more absorption of water to allow for easier passing . If my son is even late on a dose then we are literally having to dig the stool out which is often accompanied by a bloody bum . Gross I know , but so sad as a mom to watch . Our poor babies and the crap they have to go through ! ! ! My son also eats practically nothing . We started our son of the Gluten Free Casein Free diet about 4 months ago and are noticing improvement in both his stool and eating . In the last couple weeks he 's started at least touching food and puting it to his lips . Every once in a while he 'll stick food to his tongue . He get a daily liquid vitamin and protein shakes . Since we are milk & amp ; wheat free we buy a brown rice protein powder you can get at a health food store . Another `` cheater '' way we get nutrition is through Chocolate Nesquik ( another GFCF food ) . If you 're not interested in trying the GFCF diet than any breakfast shake/protein shake will do . Our dietician says as long as he gets a liquid vitamin and some way to supplement protein he technically ok.- Shanda-lyn - Mom to Blake 4 yrs ( ASD ) and Maria 2.5 yrs old ( Dysphagia , GAD , Restless leg syndrome and sensory issues galore )
