i have been seeing dan doctor DR RAO in dallas for six months . first he put our son on lots of vitaminand b-12 shot , we did all testing for yeast , mercury and anything we should know . with b-12 shot my son had very bad reaction , hyper , winning , echololia got way worse , not paying attention , ... . he said he has to change the b-12 wich he was on for 4 months . from mb12 we switch to hb-12 , the bad habit he got from mb12 is gone except the echololia , he took test for mercurry 3 times . 2 times it wasnt to bad , so he had to do it 3 times to make sure the mercury is high and last time it show it was high . he started the iv chelation today . my concern is when we go to DAN dont they tell us in first or second visit what we need to do or every time we go they say something else , and do you let them try every thing they suggest do to your child or not ? im very obset and mad . because the only problem my 6 years old son has is speech . and the doctor tells me more echololia is good but its disturbing and he do it way more than before . also they tell me you have to try this thing for 6 months if i dont see the reult do i continue or its money buissnes this doctors doing .
