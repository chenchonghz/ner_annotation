We 've had our son ( now 8years old ) on Vit B12 injections now for 2 years and are still giving them every 3 days . He gets them in the morning . Recently he has become really hyper after getting it and it has carried over into school . We are wondering if the B12 is causing this . We 've made no other changes to the supplements he is on . He has been making really nice gains and we are wondering if the B12 is really contributing to this now and are thinking of starting to spread the injections out in a slow wean to see what happens . Just wondering if anyone has had any experience with this and your thoughts . Thanks for your input . VJ- vjf
