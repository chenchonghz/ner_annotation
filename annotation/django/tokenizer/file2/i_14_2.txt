Hi , my daughter is PDD-NOS high functioning but with extremely bad tantrums . We saw a Doctor at the Optimal Wellness Center in Illinois it 's on the web `` Mercola.com '' . Her metabolic body type came back that she should eat high protein and she now eats high carbs . The theory is that the bad behavior comes from her insulin levels being too high and also she is wheat intolerant . I am working with a nutritionist to modify her diet . Wish us luck , anyone else done this type of thing with a doctor , supplements and radical nutrition plan please let me know how it 's going . For now were off to Whole Foods to purchase GF foods and low glycemic foods . Let me know what you think.- Rosalie
