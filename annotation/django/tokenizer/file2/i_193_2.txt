I have not posted much lately but I have to add that 3 months is not a long time . My own son went on the DAN protocol at age 4 after two years of intense ABA ( 25+ hours a week ) and Speech . He made wonderful gains but not enough on just traditional therapies alone . What we did find is that while certain things worked well , others really showed very little effect . We know when we get a `` Wow '' because we only add one thing at a time . We also have ABA , and Speech at the same time My son just turned 7 last weekand he is in a mainstream 1st grade class with a shadow ABA therapist . The therapist at this point takes data and helps couple of other boys in his class . He went from nonverbal at 2.5yrs to being one of the top students academically . We are pretty close to graduating from the ABA . These are some of the things we have tried or still do . Actos Antifungal Anti viral Chelation DMG Colostrom Enzymes Glutathione ( IV ) GFCF HBOT ( hard ) LDN MB12 ( injections ) Namenda Probiotics Vitamin/mineral supplementaion We are adding OSR in the next couple of weeks and we are considering IVIG ( it will be a big fight to have insurance pay for it ) I am sure I left out something but I have a list of items that I would like to try for my little guy . It is not a one size fits all . If you feel that the DAN protocol really does not benefit , there are others to try . NIDS/Yasko to name a couple of others . - Mom to ds age 17/nt dd age 14/nt ds age 6/asd
