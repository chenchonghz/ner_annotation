DS ( 9 ) Asperger 's has been on buspar for a couple of years and it worked well until he topped out on the dose and started having more meltdowns . So , then we tried Zoloft . He was activated and disinhibited on 25mg dose , so we lowered it to 1/2 that . He was ok , but meltdowns still occured pretty regularly , so we discontinued that to see if `` no medicine '' would be ok and to get a baseline . Well , he was miserable for several weeks , so we decided to try something else . For some reason , the dr. got in his mind that we were trying to target his ADHD symptoms this time and gave him adderall ( short acting ) . No help and still meltdowns , so now the dr. is trying prozac . Any experience with it ? We also tried lexapro in the past . He was activated and disinhibited on that as well . I 've heard just recently that often kids on the spectrum need less of an antidepressant dose than other kids . True ? LMK your experience with prozac or other SSRI 's . He has very low frustration level leading to meltdowns so that 's what we 're targeting.- Me , 34 Bipolar DH , 35 Depression , ADHD DS , 9 Asperger 's , Anxiety , ADHD , Developmental Coordination Disorder , DS 7 Bipolar , ADHD DD 5 Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety
