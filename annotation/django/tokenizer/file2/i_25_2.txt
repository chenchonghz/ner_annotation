I am researching chelation methods and really want to be thorough with it . DAN recommends DMSA and I am thinking we can try suppository but I 've also seen some other `` less intense '' ( I think ) methods like LiverLife + NDF , or ALA. Can anyone tell me what their experience has been with any of these methods ? - Mom to beautiful twin girls , 2 years old , dx pdd-nos
