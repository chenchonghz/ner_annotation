My son is set to start this because he has been taking steriods for a condition and started taking antibiotics for a sinus infection and both these can let the yeast take over . On antibiotics alone has has gotten fungal infection on his feet and diaper area and also ring worm . He takes a probiotic daily . Any side effects ? How did it go ?
