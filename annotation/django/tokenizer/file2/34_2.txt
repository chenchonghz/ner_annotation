I would strongly urge that anyone considering treating a liver issue, should get liver function tests first, and chelating should get proof of high levels of metals.I believe that treating something that doesn't actually exist in a child is just as damaging as not treating something that does.Not all kids wit autism have other medical problems, some are otherwise healthy. I worry about these kids getting all sorts of treatments that they don't need.edited for spelling Edited by Allegra on June 27 2007 at 7:26am-    Sharlet 7 ASD (mod-sev), Nina 5 Still unknown.
