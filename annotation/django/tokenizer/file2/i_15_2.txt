I have a son who is 4 1/2 years old and he has been diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Delay . I guess that falls somewhere under the umbrella of Autism . I would like to get David to take vitamins and natural herbals , but , the difficulty I have is getting David to take them . He will take gummi bears ( multivitamins ) , but , anything else ... . he knows when you are trying to give him something . I have tried Peanut Butter , wrap candy around them to disguise the taste and mix it with some other foods to hide the smell and taste , but , in all honesty I have not been successful and I have , for now anyway , given up until at least he got a little bit older . Has anybody developed a fool-proof method of getting their children to take various types of medications ? The examples of pills I am trying to get David to take are : Selenium , Omega Essential Fatty Acids , Calcium-Mg tablets , DMAE and Potassium . Also , I have a problem of getting David to sleep sometimes . He will wake up at 2-3 am in the morning wide awake and it is sometimes hard for me to get him to lay down . He goes until he just collapses from exhaustion and falls asleep . That is frustrating when he has to go to school . I have thought of trying Valerian , but , then again I have the problem of getting him to take the product . Does anybody have ideas on these problems ? Your replies would be very much appreciated . - Running Warrior
