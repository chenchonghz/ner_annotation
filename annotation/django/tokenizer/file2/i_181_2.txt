CURCUMIN ( Enhansa ) TREATMENT FOR AUTISM One very important thing to bear in mind when you are using curcumin to treat autism symptoms : Curcumin has a pretty short half-life in the body - as short as 3 hours . This means that 6 hours after each dose of curcumin , only about 25 % of that dose will remain in the body . So the trick is to give a does every six hours : say once at breakfast , once at lunch , once at supper , and once before bed , in order to keep the body levels up . This way , the anti-inflammatory action of curcumin is always at full power , preventing inflammation from arising in the brain . Brain inflammation is thought to underpin many of the symptoms and behaviors of autism . In autism it is NF kappa-B inflammation that is casing many of the problems . Curcumin is a potent inhibitor of NF kappa-B inflammation . So you need 24 hour curcumin protection , to stop the NF kappa-B inflammation in the brain . Otherwise there will be times during the day that the inflammatory creeps back . Note : soya lecithin can increase the bioavailability ( absorption ) of curcumin by 5 times ( 500 % ) , so it might be a good idea to include some lecithin as well . http : //chronicsorethroat.wordpress.com/ I hope this helps .
