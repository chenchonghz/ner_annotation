I think most people take Waoria 's word for it that it is a chelator . All I can say is that the pulls did not change with or without . But for those kids who did respond it is a good intervention . Boyd Haley also did not find it to be a chelator , although his study was test tube oriented rather than clinical . Yes we do see progress with antiviral protocols for a subset of these kids . For some it can be the treatment that maks the biggest difference . But the antiviral protocols effectivness is still behind mb12 , hbot , diet , antifungals , chelation . Those protocols still seem to get the highest response rate.Edited by rlneub on November 08 2007 at 2:27pm
