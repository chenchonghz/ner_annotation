Hi jasweski- I 'm the aunt of an autistic niece and also a pharmacist . My niece was taking Diflucan approx 6 weeks which at this time she caught a virus and had a fever ( temp 103 ) . She had 2 seizures induced by the fever . I phoned the manufacture of Diflucan ( Pfizer ) immediately to request any clinical information on this subject . Pfizer has received reports of seizures in post marketing surveillance . However , they did any have any follow-up information regarding these reports ( i.e.clinical outcomes , long-term effects , etc. ) . Even though it is stated in pharmacy indexes that seizures have not been proven to be caused by Diflucan , I think it is safe to say it does lower the seizure threshold since enough incidences have been reported to the manufacturer to be noted in drug information resources . Also , after much scouring on the internet , I found an excerpt from a Handbook of Psychiatric Medications ( printed in the early 90 's ) , that AIDS patients who were receiving Diflucan and spiked a fever , had an increased risk and incidence of seizures . I believe it stated about 1 % . So my advice would be if you have someone on Diflucan and they start to have symptoms of a cold or flu , stop the diflucan immediately . Because once their temperature rises , their risk of seizures increases . Better to be safe . I have n't done any research on the probiotics and seizures yet . I hope the above info is helpful . - Aunt Anita
