I would like to ask Julie or any other mom regarding the chelation ( Mom 's that already done chelation with their kids ) . To parents or other people that against IV please do not say bad thing about my decision going through chelation . It is my decision to do chelation for my better son , i dont need criticism . Julie , you mentioned that your boys going for chelation . I am sure you 've done it many times and you already knew what best for them . I 've just started with DAN doctor here in Pleasanton . We started one week IV EDTA and one week EDTA suppository . We use EDTA purely because his blood test showing high level of aluminum . We 've done it for 3 weeks already ( 2 IV so far ) , should I see improvement ? what kind of improvements ? he is hyper after the IV for sure , more calm after the suppository . He will be 4 on 3/22 . Should I do another challenge test with DMPS and DMSA ? should I keep going with EDTA - if i do have to keep going with EDTA , for how long ? I wanted to make sure that I dont jump to a diff . medicine too quickly and missing the improvement just because i dont see anything for few weeks . I do notice he sits better and understand more to what i 've said but he still not carrying one on one converstation like typical 4 year old ( ie . not responding to my questions such as : how are you , how is your day at school etc , etc ) . Please let me know , Thank you very much ! !
