One thing to note in this discussion is that the administrator may not have a true understanding of what training/teaching PECS is . The use of the acronym `` PECS '' with many educators AND parents has come to mean simply using picture schedules and picture exchange , not necessarily the actual protocol of the PECS System . Perhaps speaking with the administrator and educating him/her to have a clear understanding of what the PECS System is , how the protocol works , would help them to better - and more accurately - explain to parents what actually IS used in the school , i.e. , picture schedule , allowing children to use their PECS notebooks , etc . The `` PECS '' name has been trademarked , and the protocol that is used to teach PECS is patented . If the administrator is stating to prospective families that the school `` implements PECS training '' or teaches using the PECS System , and it does not , then the administrator and/or the school are vunerable to being sued for trademark and patent violations , and by her statements she has created that situation . Perhaps that might be motivation for changing her statements or for the teachers to obtain proper training . - COPAA Advocate Member , MPact Mentor , single parent to 4 ages 19 to 6 , all with disabilities .
