I do n't have a solution for your son ( my own DS had some aggressive episodes in Jr. HI , so I know that Districts take the gloves off when violence threatens . They are afraid of other parents suing ) . I do , however , want to say something . It is very , very unfortunate but many of our kids who may have brilliant minds will never , ever get to use their brilliant minds because of their behaviors . SOme behaviors are caused by school personnel mishandling a student , but most come from within . Who knows why . My personal feeling is that it 's probably a waste of time to try to find out why in the larger sense . But it 's very good policy to try to find out why in the immediate sense . That 's what a Functional Behavioral Assessment is for . Best practices says that a Functional Behavioral Assessment must be performed in order to develop a positive and effective Behavior Intervention Plan . There is EXCELLENT information on the CECP website on FBA 's and BIP 's . I do n't have the web address right here but search CECP . It 's not an autism site - I think it 's site for behavioral disorders . But it has some great information . BTW , my 6ft . 250 lb . 15yo takes a total of 6ml . of Risperdal , 60 mg. of Buspar and 2.5 mg of Tenex each day . He also gets Trazadone on an as-needed basis in the evenings ( most evenings ) and I have Ativan for panic attacks . He never seems to need Ativan these days , thank goodness . I guess I got sidetracked because what I wanted to say is that if you and the doctors and the schools , working in concert , can not prepare your son to deal with the real world , his high academic achievement will get him nowhere . Try to get an advocate to help you get what your son needs in order to get and keep a job some day and live in the neurotypical world . I know just how hard all of this is because of my own experiences , so I have tremendous empathy for you .
