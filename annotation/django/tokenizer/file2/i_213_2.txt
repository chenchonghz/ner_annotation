Background : Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that usually presents in early childhood and that is thought to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors . Although abnormal metabolism of methionine and homocysteine has been associated with other neurologic diseases . Objective : The purpose of this study was to evaluate plasma concentrations of metabolites in the methionine transmethylation and transsulfuration pathways in children diagnosed with autism . Design : Plasma concentrations of methionine , S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) , S-adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH ) , adenosine , homocysteine , cystathionine , cysteine , and oxidized and reduced GLUTATHIONE ( we have oral presentation ) were measured in 20 children with autism and in 33 control children . On the basis of the abnormal metabolic profile , a targeted nutritional intervention trial with folinic acid , betaine , and methylcobalamin was initiated in a subset of the autistic children . - As an autism researcher , after few yeas of concentrated research we have finally made a definite progress regarding a possible solution towards THE AUTISM MEDICAL CONDITION .
