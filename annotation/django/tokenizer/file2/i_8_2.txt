She reached all her IEP goals set for for the school this year in less then 4 months . We are redoing them now . If she could talk which she does , but it is limited , you would not be able to tell she had a problem . When we started this process she was DX PDD-NOS . She did nothing but sit in front of a T.V and was not even potty trained . This is at 14 months of TD DMPS src= '' http : // '' > Edited by Cross7 on January 28 2007 at 9:46am-
