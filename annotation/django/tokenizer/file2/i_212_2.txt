How much does your son weigh and how much Risperdal does he take . I hate when a doctor just doubles a med . The children 's system needs to adjust gradually . I only add in small amounts at a time to see when I start to get a reverse affect . Here is a list of the most known side affects of the meds our children take ... Psychostimulants : Ritalin , Dexedrine , Cylert , Adderall Known side effects : Decreased appetite , insomnia , gastrointestinal pain , irritability , increased heart rate , paradoxical worsening of symptoms Anti-Depressants : Paxil , Wellbutrin , Imipramine ( Tofranil ) , Nortriptyline ( Pamelor ) , Luvox , Remeron Known side effects : Cardiac complications , impulsiveness , psychosis , mania , seizures , high blood pressure , confusion , insomnia , nightmares , rash , tics , tremors , loss of coordination , anxiety , sexual dysfunction , abnormal skin sensitivity to sunlight Mood Stabilizers : Lithium ( Lithobid ) , Depakote* ( Anticonvulsant ) Known side effects : Gastrointestinal complications ( nausea/vomiting , diarrhea ) , tremors , decreased white blood cells , malaise *Side effects of Depakote also include double vision , drowsiness , loss of coordination , rapid eye movement , skin rashes Beta-adrenergic blocking agents : Propranolol Known side effects : Decreased heart rate , Raynaud 's phenomenon , lethargy , impotence Neuroleptics : Risperdal , Zyprexa , Seroquel Known side effects : Acute irregular muscle movements , cardiac arrhythmia , motor restlessness , sedation , cognitive dulling , social withdrawal , Tardive Dyskinesia , liver toxicity , Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome , sudden death I highlighted cognitive dulling . My guess is that your doctor raised his Risperdal to quickly for your son 's system to handle . - Blessings , Michele
