Antiviral properties would be a good thing since our ASD kids seem to have viral issues . But what do you think of the fact that Michael Lang was promoting zeolite as one of his preferred chelators ? He listed a protocol on his Brainchild website that I read a few days ago that specifically included/promoted the use of zeolite . Surely he was a respected member of the think tank . Could he have been wrong about zeolite 's chelating abilities ? Has your practice/doctor in Edison seen improvements with antivirals specifically ? Do you think they need to be accompied by antifungals as suggested by Stan Kurtz ? Also , has anyone heard of TSO ? Or tried it ?
