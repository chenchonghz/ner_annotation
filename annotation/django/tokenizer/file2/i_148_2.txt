Hi ! I just ordered the following supplements for Katelyn : Vit/Min : Kirkman 's Spectrum Complete hypoallergenic powderCalcium : Kirkman 's Calcium with magnesium and vit D liquidEnzymes : Houston AFP PeptizydeI was reading the bottle of Katelyn 's current gummy multivitamins and there is NO magnesium . Even though I knew the gummy calciums did n't have mag , I did n't even think to check the vits . Therefore , I would assume that this means all of the gummy calciums I have been giving her have been doing nothing ? Could this explain the increased eye stimming since the diet ( I read online that lack of calcium can cause eye stimming ) ? So when these supps arrive , I can not just give them all to her at once , right ? Should I start with the calcium or the enzymes or the vit/min ? Also , she has been SCREAMING like a banshee lately , nonstop , and it is excrutiating Could this have something to do with a deficiency somewhere ? Thanks as always for your tremendous help !
