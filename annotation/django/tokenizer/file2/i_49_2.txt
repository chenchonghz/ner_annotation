JulieA Thanks so much for the IV feedback . Makes me feel a little better . My son actually is great drawing blood but so nervous that he throws up after the appointment - poor little guy . So I ca n't imagine what an IV may do to him . BTW - I am in South Florida , the Doctor is not listed on the official website but is considered a DAN doctor . She is located in Davie , FL right near Nova Southeastern . Her name is Dr. Zeno . No , we have not done a Urine Porpyrin test for metals . My son was full of yeast based on the BM sample plus he was sooo full of yeast that his blood would not spin , so we could not even test for sensitivities until the anti fungal kicked in . After months of Anti-fungals etc his system has cleared up tremendously and we drew blood and now he is on the GFCF diet and is onto the next BM test to see if we have cleared up his gut . The DAN doctor suggested not doing many other tests until we have this issue tackled . I am glad you suggested the URINE test b/c he is going to a regular PEDI appt for a well checkup ( its just so much closer for me ) and I was hoping I could get scripts from my Pedi doctor for testing that might actually be covered by insurance ... the urine test sounds like that may be one for that meeting . Anything else or any other tests you all feel would help - please let me know - Florida ASD Mom
