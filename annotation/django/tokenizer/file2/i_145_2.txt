Daegandays , You 're going to find a lot of opinions both for and against DAN doctors , but I just wanted to reassure you of one thing . You are in control of your child 's treatments ; they ca n't force you to do anything you do n't feel good about . 90 % of what they do is just adjustments to the diet and nutritional supplements anyway , so it 's not like it 's a dangerous , invasive regimen . I encourage you to read up on the subject and form your own opinion . There are a number of other parents on this board who do biomed for their kids and have seen wonderful results . I hope that some of them respond too so that you get a good idea of how it works . A good place to start reading is the book Children with Starving Brains . There are also a number of great websites to help you get started - two are www.generationrescue.org and www.talkaboutcuringautism.org . We 've only scratched the surface of the DAN protocol with our son , and in 8 months he has progressed from moderate autism to asperger 's . He was a huge responder to the GFCF diet , omega 3 's , antifungals , and several other things we 've tried . That 's not to say that he does n't also need ST , OT , and PT , but even his therapists say they 've never seen this kind of progress before . A couple are even starting to question whether he 's truly on the spectrum at all , and that certainly was not the case a few months ago . Sorry to ramble , I just do n't want you to get discouraged by the naysayers , and there are plenty of them . No , biomed is n't going to work for every child , but it 's worth a try . Please let me know if you 'd like more details about the biomed we 've done with our son . - Mom to one adorable 4 yr old boy , dx w/Asperger's
