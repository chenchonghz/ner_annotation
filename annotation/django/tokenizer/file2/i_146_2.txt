There are alot of vitamins and supplements that your dd may need . It would be a good idea to go to a DAN DR if you have one close enough . My son is on B12 shots every 3 days , priobiotics , folinic acid , and we are slowly adding in a little at a time because all his tests came back that he was lacking alot of important minerals and vitamins . I definatly would look into a DAN DR. it has made a huge difference w/ our son . I also agree w/ all the others that you should really go 100 % to see a big difference and I would try for at least 6 months . Good luck to you.- Dedicated mother of 4 wonderful kids , the youngest of which , diagnosed with Autism .
