Tenex and clonidine are actually classified as a hypertensive medications , they are not a sedative nor a stimulant . Tenex is often used in the treatment of aggression because one of its side effects is sedation or sleepiness . My son was on tenex for about 4 months last year , and while he was initially sleepier for a few days , it really did n't do anything for his aggression . He is now on adderall for ADHD , risperdal for aggression , and zoloft for anxiety . Does your doc want to treat your son 's ADHD behaviors , or is he having aggressive behaviors that the doc wants to treat ? I think that the med that is prescribed should the one that is most appropriate for the situation . Everyone responds differently to meds , and autism kids often respond differently than NT kids . I would make sure that your psych has experience working with autism , and if not , then find one who does . When starting meds , it 's often a period of increasing dosages and trying new meds until you find something that works , and you need to find a doctor who will work with you during this time.Edited by Lynny on October 28 2009 at 9:42pm- L~ Mom to Sarah 14 NT , Michael 13 ASD , ADHD and Jonathon 9 NT
