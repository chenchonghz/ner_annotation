I just wanted to give you a ( ( ( ( Hug ) ) ) ) too . You are going through so much and I know how hard it can be to have everything come at you at once . I sometimes feel like the world is crashing in on me and I just want to run away . It always passes soon enough for me and I hope it does for you as well . As far as the mercury , if he was tested and did n't show high levels then I would just try hard to focus on the new placement that will give him ABA . I did n't see where you gave his age , I may have missed it , but please trust me that there is time enough for acedemics . I do n't think you sound like a horror for wanting to investigate every possible option to help your son . I 'm sure the re-diagnosis is hard for you , but please know that there are many kids with an autism diagnosis ( my son included ) that never had biomed interventions and have made great strides . Do n't loose hope if there is not a medical reason for his autism ( heavy metal , diet , etc ) . Those of us that did n't use biomed interventions should all put videos on youtube so that other parents can see that there are kids that do progress without biomed . I feel badly for parents that think that if their child does not respond to biomed interventions that they wo n't be a miracle story . You are in my thoughts as you journey through this difficult time . I know you 'll get through it . Another ( ( ( HUG ) ) ) for you ! - Jenny Mom to Zach 11 , ASD
