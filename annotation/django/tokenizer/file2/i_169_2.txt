There are plenty of natural , safe , and cheap chelators out there , including Vitamin C , picolinate , cilantro , garlic , chitosan , and my favorite , liquid zeolite ( not so cheap but worth it ) . Zeolites are unique in that they trap only large particles like heavy metals and other harmful toxins and remove them while leaving behind needed minerals like magnesium and zinc . The others that I listed are also effective , as are Epsom salt baths in which you soak for 15 minutes and then exfoliate . Some of the more harsh chelators include DMPS , DMSA , and EDTA . With these , it 's best to do it under a doctor 's supervision just to be safe . No matter which route you choose , you should always supplement with lots of water , vitamins , and minerals to replace any that you lose as your body is undergoing the metabolic changes of chelation . There are some great websites about things like chelating safely , body detoxification , bowel , kidney , and liver cleansing , etc . If you are good at doing internet searches you should have no problem , just use the keywords `` chelation '' `` detox '' `` mercury removal '' , etc on a site like Google , Yahoo ! , or Ask.com . Good luck ! - Mercury hurts .
