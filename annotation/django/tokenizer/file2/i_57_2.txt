Reading on this site somewhere yesterday and now cant find it - people who seemed quite knowledgeable about copper toxicity . I suffer INTENSE pain , allergies , bizarre symptoms that are horrifying and never ending . Hair analysis shows too much of most metals except the good ones like zinc and sulfur so Im not detoxing well . Blood shows ca way too high . Hair analysis says copper and ca is dangerously too high . Brain scan shows very advanced ca blocking my arteries . The allergies are so bad I cant live in a house because of the formaldehyde but I cant live outside either because of trees and grass . Im a mess . How do you get this stuff out . - hopeful
