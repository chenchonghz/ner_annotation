Wow , those links are very interesting , forker . Thank you for posting them . I read quite a few articles about cholesterol and children and the concensus is basically this is something new , a screening to help prevent heart disease once the child reaches adulthood . My issue is that in many of these articles I 'm reading it IS genetic , and even if they see high cholesterol they really do n't do anything . In some rare cases when it appears extremely high they do give medication to children over 10 yrs of age . But , I also read that 90 % of children with high cholesterol later grow to have normal ranges in adulthood . See , children need fat for their bodies to grow , and for their hormones to work properly . If we give kids adult medications to lower it , we are actually doing more harm by preventing the body from going through their natural processes . I plan on adding more healthy items to my son 's diet as he can tolerate them . However , I refuse to cut out the foods that he truly loves . I think he has enough on his plate without having to worry about being on a special diet . Not to mention the fact that 3 months ago my doctor told me she wanted me on lipitor because in spite of my 10lb weight loss my cholesterol was still high . So , sometimes diet does n't really help anyways . - Mom to Dan 10 , asperger 's , and Mikey 7 , moderate ASD
