Ait , Listening , Byonetics all around great and are mostly likely to work . Most problems like this our done by Dr. 's The medical community does n't recognize it cause it is considered UNConvential methods . I disagee on the herb issue . I know people who live on them and our very healthy people . Those who know the Bible know God tells us to eat them . It is in Genesis . Meds and herbs/supplemsents should not be given at same times . Here is how I do it . I take my thyroid stuff before bed time . This allows no problems from the supplements and herbs I do in the day . Caffeine/ Citrus lesson absorbtion rates . I take all daily supplements in a liquid form . I do cause they are 98 % absorbed pills are only 10 % it is in a Dr. desk reference . Some people react different to stuff . We were told try DMEA for Focus our school said made him worse . I belive it is the cafateria food that really does it . I try it and if I see no difference we stop it . Never hurts to try . sorry to make it long .
