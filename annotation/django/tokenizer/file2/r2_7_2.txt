Hi Paulos ! First I want to say WAY TO GO for being ready to quit drinking . It takes a LOT of courage to stop drinking and face your fears and phobias . You said you have a loss of passions and a loss of intrest . You dont say if you have ever suffered from depression . I am assuming if you are on Lamictal you have bi-polar disorder ? Which also means you have suffered from depression in the past . I too have bi-polar disorder . I know on days I have problems my memory is terrible . I cant remember anything , and it is somewhat embarrasing . Could that be part of the probelm with your memory ? A lot of the problems with phobias and anxieties might be related to the anxiety you have . Have you asked a doctor about taking anti-depressants ? I take Zoloft and it has made a huge difference with the anxiety . Have you ever been to a councelor ? They might be able to give you things to do to help with your anxiety/OCD and other things troubling you . - Comer,10 and Jacob,5 both PDD
