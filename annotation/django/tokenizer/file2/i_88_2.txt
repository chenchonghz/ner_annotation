Well he is getting in home services to make up for the week he lost . But with his latest blood test his depakote level is at 31 and it should be at 51 . So we have upped the depakote by one capsule . Then we will take his blood again to see what the level is at . Previous experience with this has shown us that if the depakote is too low he tends to have more aggressive behaviours . Now the school , lol , have to wait until the end of August to even schedule his IEP meeting . But if they have summer school at the same location next summer as they did this summer , I will have to put up with the same aggressive behaviours . Seems like I might have to put a call into his old teacher and get him onboard in training the current teachers on how to deal with him . Oh the fun never ends , lol .
