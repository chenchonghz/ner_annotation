Prozac and lexapro are two different classes of anti-depressents/anxiety medication . Lexapro is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor . ( SSRI ) A doctor explained it to me this way . People have serotonin in their brain and also in their stomach . When you are anxious ... your body uses more serotonin . Some people can produce enough to replace what they are using . Others do not and during stressful periods they use their serotonin reserves . ( Ever hear people talk about nervous stomach ! ! ) It is your body depleting it 's serotonin . An SSRI like lexapro helps keep your level of serotonin constant . I do not know any children who take it ... but I know MANY adults who do without incident . -Everything has side effects . It takes adults about 2 weeks to feel some effect of the meds and 6 weeks for them to feel the full effects . This is NOT a medicine that you want to come of quickly , because there will be withdrawal symptoms . The common adult dose it 20 mg ... many adults do very well with 10 mgs . I am not a doctor , but this was information that I have gathered while helping a family member begin the meds . I know it must be hard to even think of putting your child on these meds , but anxiety can be debilitating for adults who have coping skills . Imagine how hard it is on a little guy who is too young to have any coping skills . Maybe he is unable to eat because he is so anxious all the time . ( You know that feeling when you get when you are really nervous , or something bad has happened and you just ca n't swallow the food ? ) Maybe you will see great things with this med ? Best of luck . - Mom to James , Autism 6 Stephen 3
