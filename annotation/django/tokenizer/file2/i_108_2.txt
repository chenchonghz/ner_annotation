Mikey is on heavy doses of Omega3 ( 60 IU per kilo of body weight ) along with B12 ( 100 mg ) combined with psychotherapy for stress/anxiety and so far its working . He 's been on these since he was 8 . So the only RX drug that he 's taking for comorbid issues is Clonidine for sleep ( he 's been on this for almost a year now and he 's 11 ) . Tori is on Zoloft for anxiety ( has been since March of this year ) and she 's five . For agression , we 're sticking with the heavy doses of Omega3 ( huge prison studies on this issue , BTW , just in case you 're interested ) along with B12 ( same dosage as Mikey ) . She is also on Neurontin , originally for sleep but now for a combination of sleep/nocturnal seizures . That 's it tho .
