This has been brought up before if you want to do a search . I was given orally as well ( broke through ) , then tried mag sulfate drip ( broke through that ) , then was given the pump as well , I believe the last 5 weeks ( on bed rest ) . The only other Mom ( in all my travels ) who also had the terbutaline pump was a Mom that had twin boys - both autistic . However , in my case ds is on the spectrum/ADHD and dd is NT . AnnMarie is correct . Terbutaline is an asthma drug . I was never told this . It is used off label for pre-term labor . Check out this letter from the FDA : http : //www.fda.gov/medWatch/SAFETY/1997/terbut.htm That being said - my sister was given terbutaline last year for pre-term labor.- Fraternal Twins Son- 16 , ASD , Mood Disorder , ADHD Daughter - 16 NT
