I 'm just curious to know what kind of improvements do parents notice with biomedical interventions . Recently our DAN added an anti-inflammatory with which we did see a lot of reduction in irritability , hyperactivity , and stereotypy . It 's been only two weeks now since we started it . But we are not seeing much difference in the area that we want to i.e . speech . DS is 4 now . He has a pretty good vocabulary . And he can also make pretty long sentences . But his speech is not becoming conversational . Or even if he communicates , he does so in his own special way with lots of grammatical errors . He wo n't be understood by an outsider . He has a lot of echolalia and too much scripting . This has infact increased after we started biomedical . He does not do appropriate pronoun reversal . We are doing MB12 injections too , but its difficult to say how much they have contributed because we started them along with a lot of other things . What I am curious to know is how does the speech become better ? Does it always follow with increased echolalia ? Is increased echolalia common ? In other words , how do they get the concept of communication ? Also the anti-inflammatory does n't seem like a permanent fix . He has inflammation in the brain and a lot of oxidative stress . So what could be the permanent fix for this ? May be I 'm just too anxious and want to see my child recover asap . btw , we got our final diagnosis of mild to moderate autism yesterday . Up until now he had a preliminary diagnosis of PDD-NOS and Expressive Language Disorder .
