Shellymn44 ... thanks for your feedback . I am from India ( now staying in US since 9 yrs ) and I and my family have always used homeopathy . I have always been a strong believer of homeopathy ... though it works slow..but it does work finally ( most of the time ) where other medications fail and that too with no side affects . When my daughter ( 7 yrs and NT ) suffered with alopecia areata ... after using all the avialable meds here fpr 2yrs ... finally I leaned towards homeopathy . It 's been 2 yrs ... but it worked amazingly . It was the Indian homeopathy doc who treated my DD . My son ( 2 1/2 ) is dx with PDD 10 days ago . I wanted to chose some one here rather than India coz it is related to behavior and it will be helpful if the doc really monitors him . I did get couple of good feed backs for Dr Rothernberg and Herscu . One of them is the Mom Erica from `` recoveredfromautism.com '' . I felt very happy . May be I should stick to one doc . But in finding a good doc for my DS I am getting so confused . Shellymn44 ... you mentioned about liquid dosing ... but the one the doc gave to him is 2 goblets ( I guess that 's dry dosing ) 200c of belladonna and said that it should be good enough until Aug end . I do n't know how this works . As far as I know , it should be a daily dosage . Donno if one dosage works for 2 months .
