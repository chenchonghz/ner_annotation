AndrewsMommy , The French test , measures poryphins or whatever - is that expressed as a ratio with creatine ( due to fluctating concentrations of compounds in the urine , I guess these measurements are often expressed as ratios to other things that are always in the urine ) ? I think I read somewhere that it was . If so , have you tested for creatine levels to ensure that they are not low , or is there a reference range for creatine on the test itself ? I read somewhere else that low creatine is very common with our kids ( my girls actually had slightly elevated creatine levels , which is why I looked into creatine in the first place , but I digress ) , and if a kid has low creatine , and the test uses a creatine poryphin ( sp ? ) ratio to determine elevation of poryphin ( sp ? ) , could n't what looks like an elevated poryphin level just be a lower than normal creatine level ? I 'd be interested to see the output from the report . Do you think that the report will clearly state when an elevated poryphin count could be skewed by an abnormally level of creatine ? I ask , because I note that many parents are doing these tests on their own . I expect that a doctor would know about the ways these things are measured , but perhaps not a parent , so I would hope that the tests are designed such that they could be interpreted by parents . Also , has it been proven that an elevated poryphin count neccessarily means mercury ? Could there not be a false positive , here ?
