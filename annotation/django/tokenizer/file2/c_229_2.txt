My ds has been on depakote for about 10 mths now for seizures , we just increased the dose 6 wks ago and are seeing improvements . When he started his teacher noticed some hand trembles , but it has all gone away . We have prescription Carnitor but so far I ca n't get it in him ( tastes awful ) . We are meant to be using it for suspected mito and possible depakote depletion . OTC carnitor supplements are n't as reliable as the prescription , not sure which you are using . Zach had low carnitine levels before starting depakote , and his levels have n't changed since he 's been on depakote . Did your neuro check carnitine levels ? My only thought is maybe it 's time to try a different anti-convulsant . I probably have n't been much help , and I know how hard it is to change these meds . Depakote has done wonders to stabilize my son 's moods and sleep , and I 'm always worried we 'll have to change it due to side-effects . I hope you can find answers for Carlo soon.- Pauline mom to 17 y/o twins N/t , and Zachary 5 y/o autism
