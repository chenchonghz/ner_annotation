I have read case studies in which DMPS given through injections can cause death to autistic children. Why is this? Because children's bodies are fragile and thus, can't normally handle all the mercury that is released from deep inside their organs. Remember: mercury is a highly toxic substance that must be removed slowly from the body so it won't cause no harm.
