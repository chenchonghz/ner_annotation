My son is 10 , almost 11 , and has been on Concerta for a few years . It has been a miracle medication for us , and I ca n't imagine him NOT taking it now . We tried Strattera , and it was a nightmare for us . It just did n't work at all . He had also been on regular Ritalin before , but as most of you know , it wears off quickly and the child can experience drastic changes between doses if it 's not timed perfectly . Concerta works perfect for us . We have n't had any noticable side effects or issues with it . Oh , there is one thing ... .. Concerta 's release takes a while initially to take effect . It has a slower release time initially and increases as the day goes on . This did cause a problem for my son who was required to be focused first thing in the morning upon arriving to school . The medicine had n't really gotten into his system and taken effect by that time . To solve that problem , his psychiatrist dosed him with a low-dose of Ritalin early in the morning , which takes effect fast and wears off about the same time that the Concerta is hitting its peak . It works perfect .
