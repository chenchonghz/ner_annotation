forwarded to me on another board . Unfortunately we have the zinc . Lucky for my kids I 've been a supplement slacker and not given them much of that particular one ... December 30 , 2009Dear Kirkman Customer and Distributor : It has come to Kirkman & # 146 ; s attention , that a raw material supplier has been supplying Kirkman with substandard quality material that is higher in antimony content than what would be considered acceptable to the special needs community . Raw material suppliers are actually not required to test for antimony levels routinely , so Kirkman was not aware of this problem until physicians using Kirkman products brought the issue to our attention as a result of their metal testing . We immediately had our laboratory research the issue which they quickly isolated and linked to two specific lots of stevia leaf extract . We have stopped using this material and have located and purchased a quality replacement which we will begin using immediately.We are asking that if you have any of the following products which utilized this material in your inventory , that you destroy the products and request credit or replacement with new lots when they become available . Call Kirkman customer service to make these requests . The products involved include all lots of the following products : 1 . Zinc Liquid Product # 387/8 and 387/16 2 . Super Nu-Thera w/o A and D & nbsp ; Product # 447/4543 . DMAE 50 mg. Chewable & nbs p ; & nbs p ; Product # 489/904 . Super Nu-Thera Powder Orange Product # 410/4545 . B Complex Powder Pro Support Product # 399/7 6 . TMG w/Folinic and B-12 Powder Product # 413/4 and 413/87 . Chewable Vitamin C Tablets & nbsp ; Product # 389/100 and 389/2508 . Trial sizes of the above seven products Kirkman regrets the inconvenience associated with this issue , but Kirkman will not compromise our quality standards that we have stood for throughout our existence .
