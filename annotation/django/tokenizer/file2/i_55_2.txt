Hello everyone , My daughter is 10 years old . When she was 2 years old , she started showing symptoms of Autism . We had plenty of investigations & amp ; lab tests made for her & amp ; they all came back negative . few months earlier , we made a test for heavy metals in which samples of her blood & amp ; hair were taken & amp ; the test revealed that she has excess zinc in her body ( more than 700 ) which as I have been told is too high . My question is does anyone know where can I find a chelating drug that can eliminate this excess zinc ? ? thanks in advance
