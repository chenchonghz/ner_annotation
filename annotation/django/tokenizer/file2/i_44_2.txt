I worked for many years as a chemist and I am quite familiar with EDTA . I would not use this without the approval and supervision of a physicican . It has the potential to poison the system , and strip out helpful as well as harmful minerals . Taken orally I do not think you could absorb an adequate amount of this material to effectively chelate minerals stored in the body . It is used in intravenous treatments , but these are performed ( hopefully ) under a physicians supervision . A physician should only prescribe this treatment after both they and the patient understand the risks , symptoms of poisoning to watch for , and the expected benefits outweigh the risks . I understand the desperation of a parent with an Autistic Impaired child . My 12 year old son Joseph is AI , and just came home from his second stay at a Psychiatric hospital today . I have spent much money on alternative cures , and have seen little benefit from them . My advice is to work with a trusted healthcare provider and love your child with all your heart . As a parent your hearts desire is to fix your child . Somethings are just beyond are ability to fix . - SelwynSR
