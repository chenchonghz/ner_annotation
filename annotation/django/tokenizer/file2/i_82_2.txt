Hi ! I am a music therapist in Central NJ . I 've been reading the posts regarding finding a music therapist in your area ( TX , KS , etc ) . Please contact the American Music Therapy Association at info @ musictherapy.org to request a list of music therapists or universities that have a music therapy degree program in your area . You can also check out the website for the AMTA at www.musictherapy.org and then find out more about your region 's music therapy presence . Of course , you can always contact me , and I will try to help you as best I can to get a referral .
