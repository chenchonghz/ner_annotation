My wife was NEVER on any antidepressants during her pregnancy ... yet we still got an autistic child . So can taking antidepressants lead to having an autistic child ? I DO NOT BELIEVE SO ! ! p.s . Holly_WA , I always thought Benadryl was prescribed to those having cough though I know of it 's sedative effect from its antihistamine .
