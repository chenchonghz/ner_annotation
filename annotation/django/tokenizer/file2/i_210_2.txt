Yes , my son 's doctor is a DAN doctor . We 've only been seeing him for four months ( we got a late start down this path as my son just turned 13 ) . His doctor wants us to start the mb-12 shots with him , which I 'm planning on doing . On concern is-if the mb-12 shots help significantly , how will I know which is which , as we 'd just have started this . Yes-as far as what I 've read it does n't seem like it would harm him . I 'd prefer to see results through methyl B-12 , as it 's a natural treatment . I have questions like-would the effects be lasting , or would he only be able to have better frontal lobe funtioning while taking the drug ? Would he need to take it forever ? What I read sounds good , but I do n't know if it 's healing anything , or making anything work better long-term , vs just while taking the drug . My son DOES have great difficulty in his frontal lobe & amp ; with executive functioning-he 's severely dyslexic . Has communication difficulty . Sometimes I do n't know if certain ways he is is because of dyslexia , or because of ( high functioning ) Aspergers . So what it says it does would be targeting areas in his brain which do n't work properly . I do n't know , though , if it 's only while taking the medicine , vs a healing medication which causes something long-term to occur . One place said no side -effects . Another place had some listed . Thanks for your thoughts . - mom of 2 boys , 15 & 13 dyslexia , ASD
