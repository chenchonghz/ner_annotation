I have not tried Byonetics or any other non-medical therapy . But I have to agree with the posts that say if it is so great we would hear more about it . Also if he wants to help people it seem to cost a lot for some CD 's . I would like to go back to the begining of the thread were people were speaking about the vitamins and herbs . Vitamins and herbs are NOT harmless . Most medications were formulated from something in nature . You do need medical supervision if you are giving your child any `` Natural '' supplements . Also , if these other types of treatment , then the only way to tell would be if the child was only getting that and nothing else . Most of us have done many kinds of treatment . It is a combination of treatments that seem to offer the most hope . - Dawn mom of Adam age 14 - PDD NOS , ADD , Anexity disorder . Also two NT kids ages 11 and 9 .
