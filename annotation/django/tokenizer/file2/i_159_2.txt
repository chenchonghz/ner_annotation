Hi Sparkysmomwhere possible , avoid synthetic vitamins as they may not be absorbed as well as naturally source ones.For exampleMost Vitamin E supps will bed-alpha tocopherol - a natural formsome will bedl-alpha tocopherol - a synthetic formhowever vitamin E is made up of 8 different componds4 tocopherols and 4 tocotrienolsand I am reliably informed that that best source to get all eight formsis a mixture of wheat germ oil and rice bran oil.forker
