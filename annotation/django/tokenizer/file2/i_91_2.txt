My son was a meds tyrant when he was little ! He would throw up anything I would give him ! I used the acetominophen suppositories for fever . You should be able to buy them over the counter from the pharmacist . They work ! No throwing up ! And doctors will often suggest when the stomach flu ( vomiting ) is present . When he would have infection that required antibiotic we would usually give an injection . Thank God this was n't often ( after tubes in ears ! ) . I used to smash up pills in a spoon and add a bit of water for my daughters when they were little . I have noticed that it is about what taste YOUR child has . Example- I ca n't take any sweet syrupy meds but will chew an aspirin even though it is bitter . Maybe your child does n't like the sweet syrupy meds they always make for kids . Good luck . 1 ) document.forms [ '_ctl0 ' ] .MSOTlPn_SelectedWpId.value = arguments [ 1 ] ; else document.forms [ '_ctl0 ' ] .MSOTlPn_SelectedWpId.value = '' ; document.forms [ '_ctl0 ' ] .submit ( ) ; } //- > Edited by shewinders on March 12 2007 at 8:33am- Life should NOT be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a well preserved body , but rather to skid in sideways , body used up , worn out and screaming WOO HOO what a ride
