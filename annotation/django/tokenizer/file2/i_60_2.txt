I am very happy to have found a doctor in the Houston area who will perform IV chelation . Before , we had to go to Dallas to have the treatment done , which was quite burdensome for obvious reasons . After calling a variety of clinics in Houston that perform IV chelation , all of them refused to treat children except one - Dr. Marina Pearsall , who runs a Longevity Center with her husband , who is also a doctor . They do n't treat autism , but are willing to provide the IV detoxification therapy . We went for our first treatment today and I am extremely pleased . They actually performed the detoxification with an IV drip rather than a push , which they said was safer and more effective . Anyway , here is a link to their website in case any of you are interested . I have no financial interest in posting this , it 's just information I would 've liked to have had as a parent . http : //www.spa-medical.com/contact.htm
