I would check what sort of research this company has done into their product . Vitamins and supplements are ok but as many doctors will tell you vitamins mostly end up going in the toilet as they are n't absorbed by the body properly and the ones that are can do harm . For example too much vitamin A is toxic . I have had many miracle treatments offered to me in the 11 years I have been dealing with this dx and mostly they have been proven to be a waste of time . I would weigh up how much therapy I could buy with the money or healthy foods that are n't too processed . I have heard of kids with ADD who have moved to a farm and been removed from the toxic environment of the city doing so much better . The problem is we do n't often have that choice . Do they have a website we could check out because I would be interested in their claims . By the way my son was tested for heavy metals by the paediatrician and he showed as being ok so I have never bothered with chelation . I have concentrated on using ABA therapy as my main treatment with very good results . Good luck with whatever you decide and keep us posted .
