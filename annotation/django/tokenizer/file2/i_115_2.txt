Hi everyone , My 7 yo sons Psych wants to pull him off Strattera and try this new drug called propranolol , I looked it up and it is a drug usually used for high blood pressure , chest pain , etc . We have had great academic successes on the Strattera , but the moody angry meltdowns have started to come a little more often . We also give him 4mg of Abilify a day to deal with some of the anxiety issues.He has a dx of pdd-nos possible aspergers , ocd , adhd . He is a highly functioning boy in mainstream school plugging along as well as he can . The strattera has helped him leaps and bounds on his school work and I think social wise as well after being on it for about 3 months now . I 'm a little Leary to pull him off to give up the advances for the exchange of less melt downs , I know there should be somewhere in between we could meet..Has anyone else used a beta blocker , blood pressure med with success for a child ? Thanks so much for any input ! Bridget - son Brady age 7 pdd-nos traits of autism , ocd , adhd
