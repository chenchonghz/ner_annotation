I am new to this forum . I have a 10 year old boy named John . John started having grand mol seizures at age 8 months . He was on target for everything except language . It took until he was 3 years old to find a doctor who could put a stop to the seizures . Once the seizures were controlled he was able to start speaking . John has always been an easy , happy baby . Out of my four children , he was the easiest . After grade K , we started to see that there were other issues going on . When John turned 6 he was finally diagnosed with PDD . John was in an integraded classroom . By age 9 he was transferred to another school in a contained classroom due to behavior , hitting peers and teachers . That was last year . This year John is in another program and school . As John gets older his aggression has gotten much worse . In Oct John was put in the hospital for psychiatric behavior and stayed for 20 days . He returned to his home school but again the behavior is getting worse and he is getting bigger . We are now talking about sending him to a behavior school . John is a loving , caring , helpful boy but on the other hand when he gets upset he is verbally abusive and physically abusive to myself and siblings . John hits , kicks bites , pushes and spits at family and school people . John is on Effexor for anxiety , Depakote for a mood stabilizer and Abilify for aggressive behavior . We tried raising the abilify but found anything over 7mg he got lathogic , slurred speach , ( he looked and acted stoned ) . Has anyone out there had their child on this much meds and still had very aggressive behavior ? And , if so , have you tried a behavior program , such as a private school and/or place that specialize in children with PDD and behavior and aggressive behavior ? As I said before , John is a wonderful boy and I want the best for him . I want him to have as normal a life as possible with the daily restraints . Michelle - Mom Loves John
