Depression comes in many different forms and is often co-existent with autism spectrum disorders . It can be dysthymia , where it 's a low-grade constant depression , SAD-a form of seasonal depression , or acute depressive episodes like you 've described . Medication is NOT always the answer , and can even cause many additional problems , as it did for me . Counseling can help , and so can talking to friends , whether online or in person . Quality nutritional supplements , as well as a good diet , exercise , and plenty of rest are also excellent mood boosters/stabilizers . There are also many physical conditions , such as hypoglycemia , hypothyroidism , and chronic fatigue syndrome that can cause a sluggish , pessimistic mood . I know what you mean about `` feeling silly '' for expressing yourself , but just know that you 're entitled to your feelings and that nothing you ever feel could be `` wrong , '' no matter how crazy , irrational , scary , or painful it seems to you . This forum is very accepting of people in comparison to many others on the net ( something I 've discovered the hard way ) , so you 've come to the right place for support . You never owe anyone an apology for expressing yourself , as it would be far worse if you held it in . Good luck and I wish only the best for you ! - Mercury hurts .
