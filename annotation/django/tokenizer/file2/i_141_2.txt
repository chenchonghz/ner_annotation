Anyone else have experience with Claritin and stims ? My son was put on Claritin in December for what was believed to be a chronic drip down the throat . He was constantly sniffling back and snorting , rather loudly . The Claritin has not cured the condition , although his sniffling and snorting is not as loud . Recently , we ran out of the Claritin , and I kept forgeting to get more . He was off it for 6 days , and in that time , he began banging his head on the concrete floor in the basement , and flapping his hands . He also increased the body slamming into objects and individuals . All these behaviors had been pretty much eliminated or significantly reduced prior to going on Claritin and remained so while on it . Only when he had to go without the Claritin did we see a return in the behaviors . Got him back on the Claritin and we 're back to where we were before starting the med . He was not able to see our family doctor when I took him in December , and the Claritin has only helped a little with the s/s stuff , so I 'd like to get him in with our doc to see what else might be going on . But I 'm now afraid to have him taken off Claritin . Any suggestions ? BTW , his s/s thing has gone on since October .
