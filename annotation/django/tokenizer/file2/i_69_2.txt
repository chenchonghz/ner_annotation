My son was first diagnosed with ADHD at 5 , at 11 he was diagnosed as being on the spectrum and having hyperness and impulsivity . I 've had a REALLY hard time with the adhd meds not really working . Adderall , dexedrine , and concerta all made him very aggressive and just outright restless ... would not sleep either ! The only med that helped for my son was Ritalin ( short acting ) . But this did n't stop him from getting up out of his seat or talking accessively . The focus part improved a bit too . You may have more success since all children react differently with different meds . I hope I helped a bit . Good luck ! - `` Show me a sane man and I will cure him for you .
