Dana , That is so interesting . We have upped Gavin 's taurine and I noticed recently we have no accidents . But I ca n't say for sure it was that cause we 've added quite a few other things as well including lauricidin and glutamine and extra caprylic acid . But it definitely could be . I would love to hear if taurine helps EssexMum at all with the potty issues . We give 500mg 2 times a day of the taurine to Gavin . I do notice this happens we he is obviously yeasty or high histamines are an issue . I have heard taurine helps with histamines . I wonder if there is a round about connection there too ? I guess something else to research ! ./images/smilies/icon_eek.gif _________________ Tami
