I have a situation similar to Zoozy ... except my boy was 5 - he was over 4 ' tall and 65 # ... all muscle . He took down 4 teachers and came after me and DH . I 'm 5'7 and dh is 6 ' - we 're not little by any means . I was terrified . We were on the phone w/ his ped neuro . ( I have his cell for emerg ) and they put him back on Risperdal immediately - the dr asked what did I have in my house b/c I keep rx for this very reason and I happened to have Risperdal which he said would make him sleepy since he had n't been on it in a while- he was on Abilify ! We kept increasing the Abilify and it got to the point the dose was n't doing anything no matter what it was at ... tried Seroquel and same thing . I was begging for tranquilizer for him and sedative for me . It was awful to be scared of a 5 year old ! OMG ! I had to keep him home from school by myself . DH called to make sure we were ok all morning ... he went to the dr appt that afternoon . He was scared too . We locked Payne in his room ( at his dr advise ) and locked the door in between and our bedroom door . It is not unheard of for them to harm parents when having a moment ... especially since Payne is bipolar as well . I just ca n't say how awful that feeling was . It was n't Payne it was something in his body ... he did n't respond to his name , he was violent , he was un-restrainable - we were trying the holds I was taught - that had worked in past , his eyes were not his own ( does that make sense to anyone ? ) - FT mommy to : Payne - 11 years old , Mikaela - 2 years old . I 'm back in school FT , Working FT ... tired as usual . Need to know ? Ask .
