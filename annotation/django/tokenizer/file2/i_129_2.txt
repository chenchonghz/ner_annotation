Ya , I have n't been impressed with the study being quoted for this . Only 13 people , adults , and not very well controlled . It 's true that oxytocin is the bonding hormone..but it 's also the hormone responsible for labor , lactation and orgasm in women . I 'll wait for more information on it myself.- http : //cadesmom.wordpress.com/
