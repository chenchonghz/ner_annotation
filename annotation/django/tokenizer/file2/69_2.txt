I appreciate the response and by ALL means please PM me with the advocate's info...it can't hurt. Where I may have left out some information lies clarity. I can demand these things because they are programs specifically offered by my son's school. They run the "Smile" ABA program in-house for our kids and an in-house RDI program. If they did not have these classes in-house I know that I could not make any sorts of demands that they staff persons with this specific education/training. However, they are already in place. We are very fortunate in this way and I intend to use it...it is also why our taxes are off the hook. They are flagship programs in my son's school. I have been looking at Bo Peeps recent posts and videos (awesome) and speaking to sunflowers about reference material. PS-I am told he was assessed for RDI today Edited by camusa on April 27 2007 at 12:48pm- Buddha Boy is 7 yrs old Dx w/ PDD-NOS,BBT 13 mos
