My son is on Strattera and Tenex and they have help him so much . We did have him on Adderall for about a year and it just did not help made things worse but all children are different so it is hard to say what would work all children are different . We did try and take him off his med 's this summer and boy was it a bad choice I thought I was going to lose all my hair within a week.- Debra , Mom to Brian ( 7 ) PDD , ADHD , MoodDisorder
