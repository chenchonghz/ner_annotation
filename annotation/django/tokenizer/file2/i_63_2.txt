Hi . I 'm Jan. My son Ethan is now 4 1/2 and was diagnosed when he was 2yrs and 3 months . He 's been having OT/Speech/ABA since then . He is now mainstreamed with a shadow . I 've never tried supplements by mega doses . He is on mulitvitamins , grape seed extract and fish oils . I 've been very skeptical about the GFCF diet but am now going to start it . I have a new questions : Where do i buy Zeolite ? is it available in the US ? Can i give my son high doses of vitaminC , probiotics , cod liver oil , minerals all at the same time ? Does he need vitamin E as well ? Where do you get the B12 shots ? i live in asia now ( but originally from Calgary , Alberta , Canada ) so i have no idea where to get them . Is it prescription ? Last , i know this is off topic but we are going for our first HBOT treatment/appointment tomorrow ... .. Does anyone have experiences with this ? thanks for all your help in advance . jan
