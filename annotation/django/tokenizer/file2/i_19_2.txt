Hi Everyone , I 'm interested in finding out if anyone has comparatively tested different oral chelation products . I 'm looking at PCRx , as it does not contain EDTA nor DMPS . However , I 'm also looking at `` Extreme Health 's '' Oral chelation formula , as it also only contains a small amount of EDTA , yet reportedly is very effective . I 'd be interested in anyone 's educated opinion ! - Bentonite ne-therapy.html '' target= '' _blank '' > Ozone Therapy || Therapeutic Clays
