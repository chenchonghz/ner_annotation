Hi everyone ! I am new to boards and I had a question about the GFCF diet and multivitamins . My 8 year old is currently taking 2 gummy vitamins from the UP and Up ( TARGET ) children 's gummy multivitamin dietart supplemment ( no gluten ) . It has come to my attention that I should also be giving him an additional vitamin for calcium and vitamin D. Here are the supplement values for the Up and Up children 's gummy vitamins ( I couldnt find it online so I had to read the bottle ) : I am listing the vitamin name , and % daily value ( there are 2 different values , one for 2-3 years old and another for ages 4 and up . I 've listed the daily values for the ages 4 and up because my son is 8 years old ) : Serving Size 2 bears Vitamin A ==== 2000IU , 40 % Vitamin C ==== 30 mg , 50 % Vitamin D ==== 200 IU , 50 % Vitamin E ==== 20 IU , 67 % Vitamin B-6 === 1 mg , 50 % Folic Acid ===== 200 mcg , 50 % Vitamin B-12 === 5 mcg , 83 % Biotin ======== 75mcg , 25 % Pantothenic acid == 5mcg , 50 % Iodine ========= 40mcg , 27 % Zinc ========== 2.5mg , 17 % If I do need to include an additional calcium and vitamin supplement for my son , would this be a good brand ? http : //www.amazon.com/Lil-Critters-Calcium-Vitamin-60-Count/ dp/B000FKHK6C Supplement information : Serving size : 2 bears Amount Per Serving and/or % Daily Value* Calcium ==== 200mg ( 20 % ) Vitamin D ====200IU ( 50 % ) Phosphorus ==== 100mg ( 10 % ) Would he take two of these gummi vites in addition to the 2 of the multivitamin ? Sorry it 's so long , but I 'd appreciate any feedback . Thank you in advance for those who reply ! !
