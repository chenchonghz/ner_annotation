I am a freelance writer and am skilled in many different forms of writing despite never having much training in any one form-essays , journalism , play critiques , music reviews , poetry , stories , plays , research articles , and others . I currently work from home ( such a blessing ! ) and write for 3 different companies , including an online hip hop magazine , a health website , and a marketing/research company . I studied theatre in college and acted in a number of productions despite my normal shyness and anxiety . I also have LOVED music since I was a tiny baby , often listening to tapes/cds until they broke completely as a child . I 'm not talking `` kid music '' , but stuff like U2 , INXS , and other popular bands of the '80s ( I was an '80s baby ) . I feel like my brain is extremely scientific in some ways and very creative in others . I 'm better at spouting off memorized facts about my fascinations than starting and maintaining a meaningful 2-way conversation , but can also be creative when the urge strikes me . I feel like I have a good sense of humor and love shows like SNL and Mad TV , but do n't always `` get '' it when an actual person makes a joke . When tested for learning disabilities in high school ( 11th grade ) , they found that my reading/grammar skills were in the `` superior/post-college '' range , while my math abilities were on a 4th grade level . I simply can not do math beyond long division and have spent many a summer at Sylvan learning center or being tutored by a cocky person out to prove I was faking my lack of math comprehension . Any other female aspies have this problem ? Edited by Tracii on September 23 2007 at 8:07pm- Mercury hurts .
