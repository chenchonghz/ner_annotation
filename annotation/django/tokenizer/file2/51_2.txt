This is from the consent form for the chelation study being done by Dr. James Adams using DMSA. To the best of my knowledge DMSA is approved for oral use only for the treatment of lead poisoning. http://www.scnm.edu/forms/AutismConsentform.pdf "Safety note re. DMSA: DMSA (Succimer) is a medication approved by the FDA for children as young as 1 year of age for treating lead poisoning. It is generally considered to be one of the safest medications for removal of lead and other toxic metals. It has not been approved by the FDA for treatment of mercury toxicity or autism, so this will be an &#147;off-label&#148; investigational use of DMSA for those purposes."
