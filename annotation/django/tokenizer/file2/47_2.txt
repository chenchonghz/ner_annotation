I am a physician. i have been reluctant to try any nutritional or medical therapies on my kids. Partly, because they hate to ingest anything other than what they like. Thus it will be a big time trouble to try any of these intervention. Reading some of these postings had rekindled my interest in trying out some of these therapies. I must warn you that some vitamins could result in deleterious effects if they are taken in large doses; particularly VITAMIN A and E. Too much folic acid may also lead to neurological deterioration in those with Vit B deficiecies. Nevertheless, I am a believer.
