Carson , PhD , RD , LD PHYTONUTRIENTS AND NATURAL COMPOUNDS FOR PROMOTING WELLNESS Natural Anti-inflammatory Support for Safety and Effectiveness Dr. Ralph Carson CHRONIC ( Persistent ) INFLAMMATION Chronic inflammation is a major factor in debilitating disease in developed countries . Persistent inflammation is frequently linked with cardiovascular disease ; cancer ; diabetes ; Alzheimer & # 146 ; s disease ; aging ; autoimmune diseases ( asthma , lupus , MS ) ; arthritis ; etc . ( 1,2 ) . The popular arthritic treatments , COX-2 inhibitors Vioxx , Celebrex , Bextra , and NSAID & # 146 ; s ( naprosyn ) Advil have been alleged to cause increased risk of heart attack and stroke and have been under FDA review ( 3,4 , 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 ) . NSAID side effects of intestinal bleeding and kidney toxicity cause hospitalization of around 100,000 annually ; some 20,000 of these die ( 13 ) . The number of arthritis sufferers is on the rise . In 1997 , 47 million Americans were diagnosed and treated for joint disease . The anticipation was that by 2010 this number would rise to over 70 million . By the year 2003 that number had already reached 70 million at a medical cost of $ 65 billion . The number of arthritic sufferers worldwide claims to be over 400 million ( 14 ) . CELADRIN & # 174 ; AND GLUCOSAMINE Safe , Natural , Effective Alternatives Celadrin & # 174 ; is a proprietary blend of the necessary essential fatty acids shown to help improve function and reduce pain for people struggling with aches and discomforts resulting from arthritis . Celadrin & # 174 ; balances fats that contribute to proinflammatory responses with fats that are associated with anti-inflammatory agents ( 15 ) . It also inhibits destructive enzymes that cause inflammation ( 16 ) . The `` wear and tear '' seen in osteoarthritis is actually due to excess action of proteolytic enzymes that break down tissue ( 15,16 ) . Celadrin & # 174 ; , made with a proprietary process of esterifying oils , is an all natural ingredient scientifically reported to reduce inflammation and pain with no side effects . Published twice in the internationally acclaimed Journal of Rheumatology , Celadrin & # 174 ; provides youthful cell fluidity and elasticity , facilitates cushioning of bones and joints and provides cumulative and restorative benefit ( 17,18 ) . Glucosamine is made in the body and is also commercially available as a natural ingredient extracted from a carbohydrate in crustacean shells . Regular use helps maintain lubricating fluid in joints , promotes flexibility , range of motion and comfortable joint function and provides a natural building block of healthy cartilage ( 19,20,21,22,23 ) . PHYTONUTRIENTS Phytonutrients are biologically active constituents heavily concentrated in the skins of botanicals and are responsible for their color , flavor and Jay Jacobs 561-373-1930- jayj
