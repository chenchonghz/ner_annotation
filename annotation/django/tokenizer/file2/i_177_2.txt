Hi , I 'm a newbie and have been reading all the posts and great info . I have a 9.5 yr old son who has been diagnosed with a few different labels by different docs . Basically , he goes to the beat of a different drummer ! He is very bright - but socially and physically awkward . He is in the `` autism spectrum/aspergers '' range . Since the age of 4 have tryed almost every adhd and ssri out there , all with the negatives out weighing the positives . Anyway , after reading many message boards on autism and adhd , decided to try dmg and omega 3s . Did not notice any real difference with the omega 3s , but did notice some improvement with dmg . He had improved listening and eye contact - yet very irritable ! ! tryed folic acid w/dmg and had very dialated eyes ? Has anyone experienced this with dmg ? Not sure if I should continue it or not . Any advice appreciated . stlmom
