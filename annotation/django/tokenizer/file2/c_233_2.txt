I just finished reading a very interesting article in the most recent Cure Autism Now `` Advances '' newletter . It was written by a Pediatric Neurologist at the Kennedy Krieger Institute by the name of Andrew Zimmerman . He talked about a study he conducted that seems to suggest a link between the drug terbutaline and autism . Terbutaline is generally used for individuals with asthma , but can also be used to arrest premature labor during pregnancy . I was one of those individuals who experienced premature labor at 24 weeks with my twins and was put on 24/7 bedrest until delivery . I took terbutaline around the clock to keep my contractions at bay . The thought is that the terbutaline causes changes in a certain receptor in the fetus brain that prevents it from `` down-regulating '' normally after birth and during the child 's development . This is the first I 've ever heard of the possibility of this drug having ties to autism . What 's interesting to note is that my fraternal twins are boy/girl . My son is the one diagnosed with ASD , my daughter is NT . The article noted that there appears to be a specific genetic susceptibility to the effects of terbutaline . I 'm just curious if there is anyone out there who frequents this board who also took this drug during pregnancy ? In my case , it 's difficult to determine whether or not I 'd have taken the drug if I 'd known there was a potential for autism ( the article indicated this is still in the research phase ) . What 's a greater risk ... ... having two babies born at 24 weeks ( and therefore possibly not surviving ) , or the slight possibility of having one or both born with autism ? Tough call .
