I have spoken to four parents at our local autism society who have tried chelation from a DAN doctor in Melbourne , Florida . In two cases , they said it helped , and the other two said it seemed to help , but not so much that they continued the treatment . A few bits of advice they offered : 1 . Read `` Children With Starving Brains '' ( `` CWSB '' ) by Dr. Jacquelyn McCandless . She researched it in detail , and has a lot of good advice . 2 . Take Zinc and Magnesium ahead of time , for months if you can . Chelation depletes these minerals from your body , as well as vanadium and selenium . If you do n't have enough of these , the chelation will not work as well.3 . You can do some chelation at home using vitamins , minerals , DMSA , and a combination of other over-the-counter supplements . The book ( CWSB ) describes this as well . Good luck
