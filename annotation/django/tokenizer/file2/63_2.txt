I reread the post and see that the IEP now states "typical peer." In that case, I'd write to the IEP Team chairperson and put in writing that the child's IEP is "out of compliance." This will get their attention and the discussion of the appropriateness of their delivery of the PT will be opened. Still, "typical" leaves lots to interpretation. I'd clarify that this should be a child who is on age level in both communication and social skills. I still think that Adaptive PE would be better unless there's a clear physical issue that can only be addressed in PT. And it's unlikely that a typically developing peer of school age requires PT, so the problem becomes how to find one, how to get that child's parents to OK his removal once a week from class. It might be best to try to get INDIVIDUAL PT on the IEP and have it as a PUSH IN in gym or recess.
