Hi JulieA , Is there a reason why your are doing the IV chelation first and then moving on the the cutler protocol ? We have been doing IV chelation twice a week ( Monday CaEDTA , Thursday DMPS ) for about 9 months but I have put it on hold because we started doing IVIG and I found that his liver enzymes go up after the IVIG infusion . We are still doing IV twice a week but without chelators - only glutathione , phosphatidyl choline , NAC and vitamin c. I also do TTFD cream almost every night . I did a UTM after one of these infusions and I found that he dumped a lot of antimony and thallium , more so than when he was on CaEDTA and DMPS ( we give him lower doses of both because he becomes stimmy when they are in the higher range ) . Now we are planning to do the cutler protocol but still want to know if this makes sense and if there is anything I need to check before I restart chelating again . Sorry for the length explanation . Thanks , Kay
