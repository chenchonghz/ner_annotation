I was on chelation myself three years ago and I was told hat i smell really bad . I had to stop the chelation . I think it was from taking NAC , reduced Gluthathione and selenium . since that time , I really take care about what supplements i am taking . I noticed that even digestive enzymes ( Houston ) do change my body odor , and not for the better .
