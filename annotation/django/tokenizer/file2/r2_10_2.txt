Paulos sure sounds like it : ) Glad you found us~many here on board can relate to what you are going through and help you out and if we cant we will sure try to point you in the right direction : ) I dont have any diagnoses but enough sx 's from early childhood to probably have gotten one in today 's world . I take Topamax for migraines..it is noted for making beer taste like crap so you may want to look into it..it also helps for bi-polar and ocd too : ) Just know that you dont have to suffer alone..there is help available and at least a 100+ medications out there to help with everything you have described~talk to your doctor ! ... some good therapy wont hurt either and coming here of course : ) Take one day at a time~become your own best advocate : ) Best of luck and keep us posted : ) - Sarah~8 yrs . old 7/27/00 Pdd/hyperlexia Stephanie~17 ( nt )
