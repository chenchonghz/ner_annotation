I agree with Tzoya. Tyler had a few sensory issues last year, that are pretty much gone now. At therapy they filled a big bin with dried rice and beans. The first week he wanted nothing to do with it. The second week they put some on his hands. By the third week he was actually sitting in the bin getting the rice and beans all over the floor!  They also had him play with thera putty and play doh. We have a mini trampoline too. One other thing they also did was had him put on a weighted vest. He did ok with it. They also did one other activity. They had a few bean bags and an empty pail. They would have Tyler pick up the bean bags and throw them into the pail.  Hope some of these things will help you. - Kari, Mom of Tyler, age 4 with PDD-Nos and Britney age 3.
