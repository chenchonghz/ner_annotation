Hi all . I have read on the Boar 's Head webpage that their meats are gluten free . I am just curious if they are casein free also . It seems like calcium is used as a preservative in a lot of things so I am wondering about this . So does it have to be preservative free ? Also , if something has sulfites , like welch 's white grape juice for instance , is it still GFCF ? I just wanted to add to this post.. I have been reading the book special diets for special kids and it mentioned that you can have some calcium enriched drinks , I believe like rice milk or almond milk , but I thought anything with calcium in it would not be CF . And what about preservatives in food like calcium phosphate , would that be allowed ? Can anyone explain this to me ? I appreciate all of your help ! !
