My 5 year son has PDD-NOS possably aspbergers syndrome. He is very violent for his age. When he doesnt get his way he bites himself and now hits his thighs so hard he is bruising himself. He is starting to get out of control and his meds arent helping. He is on 3.5 mg of Risperidol a day and is maxed out on this amount. We dont even know the side effects of this medication for his age group. I am getting scared. The drs say he is a danger to himself and others. And now his school who finally saw his tantrums doesnt want him there. I need some advice please what can I do to claim him down. I have no clue.
