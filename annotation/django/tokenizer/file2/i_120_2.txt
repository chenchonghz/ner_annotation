Dear Iansdad , Our son is on Concerta he is 61/2yrs old he has been on it for almost a year . At first we were happy our son was doing well . Then about 6mnths into it he started not listening very distracted unfocused , refusing to work or avoiding work . He is mild PDD/ADHD he is mainstreamed 1st grade . We went back to our dx and he increased meds due to our son 's weight ( he is naturally a big boy ) from 36mgs to the 54mgs Now he is on Rispodal at night .5mgs to help with anxiety aggression and frustration he has only been on it for a week . My concern is that I feel the Concerta is not working at its best anymore . How is the Straterra I have heard that side affects strong ones are tics , violent behaviors coming out . Have youheard or experienced any of these ? Nicole- nicole ; )
