Do you really KNOW ANYTHING about biomedical or is this a joke ? By the time my kids are old enough to make healthcare decisions or have an opinion about them , they 'll have been long finished with chelation . What do you think it 's something that just continues after the metals are excreted ? Chelation is not an endless process ( although slow ) , once the metal load has been pulled , chelation is no longer necessary . Anyone with a passing interest in chelation would know this . No , I would n't joke with you , you do n't seem like the joking type . There was thread recently on the AW forum where a few folks , one with a teenager , had tried stopping supplements and GFCF diet and saw their children regress . One parent said she guessed her child would be on the diet for life . It is my understanding , and please correct me if I 'm wrong , that there is some debate on whether the diet and supplements will be able to be stopped in these kids . Some people say the gut will heal eventually , others say no , that the same damage will occur if offending foods are reintroduced . Some people say enzymes may be able to be used in place of diet , others say no . And that brings me to another question , if there is a genetic defect that results in defective mercury and other heavy metal excretion as is proposed , then what is going to stop the buildup of metals again ? I understand that it is hypothesized that removing the metals will bring about improvement in autistic symptoms ( and even elimination of those symptoms in some ) , however unless the underlying defect itself is corrected , would n't it be a continual problem ? Obviously , avoidance of heavy metal exposure would be the goal , but as many have pointed out , there are many environmental sources of heavy metals , some impossible to avoid .
