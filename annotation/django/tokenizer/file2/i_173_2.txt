I 've been chatting with a couple from NJ who have had some success giving their autistic son Methyl-B12 shots ( aka MB12 or Methylcobalamin ) . They got to a DAN dr in Edison , NJ who seems well known and has 80 parent testimonials on his website ( http : //drneubrander.com/ ) They are also now tring the hyperbaric oxygen chamber ( HBOT ) thru this same doctor . I just wanted to see if anyone out there had any stories ( good or bad ) about the MB12 shots , the HBOT therapy , or this particular doctor . Thanks , Frank
