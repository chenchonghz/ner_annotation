But the liquid was only 1mg and was not GNC brand . I had to get the liquid because there is noway she is going to to the pill . It does help to calm her but it never puts her to sleep . I do n't think the 1mg of liquid Melatonin is as affective as the 5mg pills would be . Does the liquid even come in 5mg ? We have been using the Natrol tablet . We grind it up and place it in O.J . Our girl will not take any pills either . It seems to work well for us .
