Can someone tell me the difference between Supplements made specifically for `` autistic children '' vs. supplements that I can purchase at say a GNC or a health food store ? amino Acids , Digestive Enzymes and probiotics are all available locally for about 1/3 of the price ... .. am i missing something ? or does anyone know of any resource on the web I can check ?
