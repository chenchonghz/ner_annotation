He's a Chips Ahoy boy as well, but he loves to make chocolate chip cookies as well with the refridgerated dough. Mostly he just likes to eat the dough, and DD eats most of the cookies He used to eat Oreo's, but I haven't seen him eat one of those in a long time. I think I'd pass out if he ever ate a Nutter Butter. Peanut butter is evil, haven't you heard? Of course, when he was two he would eat it right out of the jar with a spoon (my personal favorite way to eat it!), but since then he won't go near the stuff. Like I said, he has eased up a bit on his restrictions, so I'm hopeful that as he enters his teens he won't be quite as neurotic about what he eats. For him I don't think it is as much a sensory issue as a perseverative one.Edited by IBGECKO on June 05 2006 at 5:48pm- Karen - Connor, 15, Asperger's, ADD & LD & Raymie, 8, NT
