I was told by my pediatrician to make sure and buy it at a GNC type of store . The thing of it is at GNC they had liquid and the pills . The pills were 5mg and they were GNC brand . But the liquid was only 1mg and was not GNC brand . I had to get the liquid because there is noway she is going to to the pill . It does help to calm her but it never puts her to sleep . I do n't think the 1mg of liquid Melatonin is as affective as the 5mg pills would be . Does the liquid even come in 5mg ? - Chris/Mommy to Abby Grace 3yrs old PDD/NOS/poss.ADHD & Danny 24months/NT with speech Delay
