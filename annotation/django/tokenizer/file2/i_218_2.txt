Well , one day not too long ago we were at wits ' end ( as usual ) , and I was thinking on the often posed question : `` what can we do ... '' with the implied RIGHT NOW ! in the picture . I 've read umpteen piles of drivel lately that boil down to `` inflammation - & gt ; autism '' and what does every American have stocked in their medicine cabinet ? NSAIDs ( Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs , such as Motrin , Tylenol , Aspirin , etc . ) So , our little guy is pretty responsive to Motrin in terms of breaking fevers , and it has been apparently harmless in the past , so why not ? Well , for starters , he is very suspicious of any doctored food or drink , and absolutely refuses to take a spoon or dropper of medicine , but he still did drink a children 's dose of Motrin in a glass of milk , and it did seem to offer slight symptomatic relief , sort of blunted the deep dark valley of the low spot he was going through . Placebo effect ? Certainly a possibility . But it got me wondering about the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and led to the paper on Actos .
