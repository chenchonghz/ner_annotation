The purpose of this 3-year naturalistic study ( March 1999-April 2002 ) is to describe the clinical outcome of a consecutive sample of preschool children with PDD treated with risperidone monotherapy . METHOD : The sample consisted of 45 boys and 8 girls aged 3.6 to 6.6 years ( mean +/- SD age = 4.6 +/- 0.7 years ) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder or PDD , not otherwise specified . Outcome measures included the Children 's Psychiatric Rating Scale ( CPRS ) , Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale ( CGI-I ) , Children 's Global Assessment Scale ( CGAS ) , and a checklist for risperidone side effects . RESULTS : Patients received risperidone for a period ranging from 1 to 32 months ( 7.9 +/- 6.8 months ) . Twenty-five patients ( 47.2 % ) continued to receive risperidone after the study was completed , while 28 ( 52.8 % ) discontinued due to side effects ( 22.6 % [ N = 12 ] ) , parents ' choice ( 18.9 % [ N = 10 ] ) , lack of efficacy ( 5.7 % [ N = 3 ] ) , and decision of the treating psychiatrist ( 5.7 % [ N = 3 ] ) . The optimal dose was 0.55 +/- 0.2 mg/ day . Significant improvement at the last observation was found in CPRS ( p & lt ; .0001 ) and CGAS ( p & lt ; .0001 ) scores . On the basis of both an improvement of 25 % in CPRS score and a score of 1 or 2 on the CGI-I , 46.8 % ( N = 22 ) of subjects were considered responders . Behavioral disorders and affect dysregulation were more sensitive to treatment than was interpersonal functioning . Responders received higher doses of medication for a longer period and had a greater weight gain than did nonresponders . Increased prolactin levels without clinical signs ( 65 % [ 24 of 37 ] ) and increased appetite ( 15 % [ 8 of 531 ) were the most frequent side effects . CONCLUSION : These findings suggest that low-dose risperidone may positively affect the clinical outcome in young children with PDD not only in the short-term , but also in the long-term period.PMID : 14628979 [ PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE ] SORRY-I THINK I AM EXCITED !
