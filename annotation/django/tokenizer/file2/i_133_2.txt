you may wish to go to my other three messages about autism- my web is biochemimbal-behavior.com HERE IS SOME INFOR I HAVE ON MY WEB ABOUT RISPERDAL DEVIRITIVES- FOR YOU YOUNGSTER NO MORETHAN 3MG DAILY- TRY AT 2.5MG FIRST- DONOT MAKE A WREHOUSED MIND OUT OF YOUR CHILD BY ALLOWING MORE THAN 3MG ABSOLUTE MAX- Many times it is necessary to use anti-psychotic drugs almost all come the original plant rauwoulfia and plant that has been used for 5000 years or more in ( ayurvedic medicine ) India and other countries for confused thoughts people have with great success . In the mid 20th century drug manufacturers in the USA used rauwoulfia to make resperine and all its derivatives , serpasil , moderil , harmonyl which are all anti-psychotics which help the racing minds and reduce so many wild thoughts in the schizophrenic and others with this problem.So from a 1000 thoughts down to perhaps 200 or less and then down to maybe 20 and even some cases down to 2 or 3.- ronalddishinger
