My daughter who is 28 months old was on Nystatin for 2 months , I saw no die off with it at all however after she was off it for only three weeks her yeasty behaviors came back . We just started her on Diflucan at 2 mls once a day for 30 days . Today is day four and no die off either however she is moving things alot . My daughter 's form of play is to take toys gather them in a pile and then one by one move them to another spot and she is doing this more . My daughter was babbling then one day it stopped and nothing for about 10 months and now she is back to babbling like a baby , I am hoping that she is talking but that the words are just not clear and that the Diflucan will help with this.My daughter is on the B12 shots too and with the two I am hoping to start getting those words out.Did you also check out information on Phenol foods because they can cause the laughing and night waking . If your son has dark circles under his eyes I would look into either limiting the foods that are high with phenol or using No Fenol enzyme 's . Please keep us posted on how he is doing . Happy New Year , Jennifer- Thanks Jen
