Hi - Anyone tried the Diflucan for fungal overgrowth , by itself , or combined with Valtrex ( anti-viral ) ? We saw Stan Kurtz 's Dan Conference video presentation , and in the video of his autistic child we saw OUR son . It hit us so hard that we wanted to know more about what he did , as his son is now recovered fully from autism . He did the Diflucan and Valtrex combo for 9 months , and his son came back . He has a school in CA with over a 1000 families doing this same approach , and having great success . I talked with him and he said to get our son on Diflucan as soon as possible , and to drop all carbs too . Our son DOES have yeast and fugus problems , and we 've been seeing one of the more `` holistic '' DAN doctors for almost a year , and still have the same issues . I do n't feel like we are `` hitting it '' hard enough , in regards to killing these bad guys in my son 's body . We 've tried this non-invasive route , and I think it 's time to try some more intense things . Our DAN doc probably wo n't prescribe this med for us ... ugh . Maybe our ped will ? Does anyone have experience with these meds ? If so , how did it go ? How long were you on them , and were there side effects ? Thanks in advance - Valerie
