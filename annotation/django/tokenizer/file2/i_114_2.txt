I had 3 or 4 shots of Terbutaline for prelabor . Just for the heck of it , I looked up Autism and terbutaline and was shocked to find so many websites on the subject , and so many people who believe there is a link between the two . Just wondering if anyone else on here received Terbutaline during pregnancy and thinks it may have been the trigger for Autism . I also read on one website that Terbutaline is an asthma medicine , and is not approved by the FDA for use in preterm labor . I do n't know if this is true or not .
