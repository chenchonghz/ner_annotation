We tried ritalin when my daughter was 6 for about one week and gave up because the rebound was so bad . We tried Concerta when she was 8 . We did n't tell the school so that they would not be biased . I had two phone calls from her teachers that first day telling me that they could not believe how well she was doing at school . So the medication certainly worked for her attention . She did , however , lose 8lbs in 6months and she slept only about six hours a night . As a result , she was very slow moving and thinking ( somewhat zombie-like ) . After a year , we switched her to Strattera but saw no results initially . We took her off quickly because she started pacing in circles ; something she 'd never done before . We then tried Clonidine which was terrible and now have her on Adderall . Adderall has worked the best ; she is still her energetic , enthusiastic self , and has improved concentration . Adderall is also easier to take for kids who are n't quite able to swallow pills . With the Concerta , I literally had to push the pill down her throat ( she was quite willing to let me do this ) because she could n't master that swallow reflex . Adderall is granular and can be sprinkled on food .
