Yes , I am a distributor because I get the product for a cheaper price , which helps me afford to continue giving it to my daughter.I 'm here to inform parents of another option which MAY work for their child . Since NCD is fairly new , most people have not heard of its existence . As I 've already said , each parent determines what 's right for their child.Apparently you 've been burned by other bio-med approaches in the past . I 'm sorry about that . I hope that cynicism does n't cause you to miss the boat on some treatment which would help your child . ( And I 'm not saying NCD is that treatment . ) You sound like a very cautious person trying to save everyone else the grief you 've experienced . While I sympathize , I think it 's unwise to totally dismiss a product based solely on its marketing plan rather than its merits , but you are certainly free to do so . - http : //www.ZeoliteWellness.com/Autism
