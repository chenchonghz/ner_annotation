My son had a first round of IV chelation therapy . It was an absolute nightmare . The DAN ! doctor then told us that she suggests 10 sessions . UGH . He is only 4 years old . I am wondering where to find out information on the oral and transdermal chelation therapies . We are waiting for the lab results of this initial dose to see if this is even his problem . But , I would really appreciate any help from people who are already working with the oral chemicals . I would like to be more educated in chelation options for the next appt . in a few weeks . Denise
