Just watch out for those nasty barotraumas and other risks ! Seizures sound kinda scary ! Quote : Serious complications that have been observed during HBOT sessions are damage to the ear ( barotrauma ) , brain ( seizures ) , and lungs ( pneumothorax ) . It must be noted that these complications are an important issue when HBOT is performed without medical supervision , and when very high dosages are used . http : //www.hochealth.com/services % 20HBOT.htm
