Homework has gotten much better as in he isnt protesting as much and dramatically as before but what i recently started doing (over the 2 weeks he was home from his surgery) is i got m&amp;ms or somthing small treat he liked and every time he did a problem hed get an m&amp;m then id stretch it to every 2 problems and 3 problems etc. And it worked like a CHARM! Ive heard of this approach before but never wanted to try it becuase i always felt like i would be treating him like a dog or something lol BUt actually in the end he loved it and he was even acting like a dog and not accepting his 'treat' unless i put it in his mouth like a dog! Ok that sounds horrible written like that but it worked not sure how beneficial it is lol- DS-8 ASD/Seizures/Mood dis/OCD/ADHD/S.I.D./Tics/GF-CF-Soy Free diet  For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord...plans 2 give you hope & a future Jer. 29:11
