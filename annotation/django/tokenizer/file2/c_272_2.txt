My son is 2.5 and his language and communication keeps expanding . Between 18-21 months he was on numbers and simple labels which we enforced through puzzles and cards every morning . Shortly after turning 2 he moved on to simple requests like want milk , water , etc.. Along with more counting and remembering everyone 's name . Currently at 2.5 we have numbers up to 50 , points to label and describe everyone and everything . Very specific with his wants , ex.. Sit on the chair over there ( point ) and watch tv . He looks at picture and describes what it is , little boy has sad face . We are working on conversation . He told me today grandma licked the icecream cone and it was amazing lol we also have questions like who 's that 's , what 's this , what does that do . In terms of therapy ... . No speech , aba , or occupation . we are on round 42 of AC chelation using dmsa once a month and ala every round at 5mg . We use essential 4 , milk thistle , cod liver oil , chewable omega 3 from Nordic naturals , chewable kids multi , vitamin c , vitamin d. Epsom salt baths and td glutathione , gse biotin and culturelle fOr yeast . He eats for the most part very healthy hOwever he does eat crappy foods now and then . We also juice leafy greens and fruit every morning . He is compiiund heterozygous mthfr . His biggest jump seemed to be around the time we were using a b complex along with mb12 orally with methyl folate . This was before he turned 2.5 . The vocabulary continues to grow .
