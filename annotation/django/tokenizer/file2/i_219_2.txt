I am going to start using it soon with Jayden . From my understanding threelac is not a probiotic but it is a yeast fighter such as diflucan or nysitan is . The threelac is supposed to be stronger and is all natural though . Have you started pro-biotics yet ? If not I would start those first before adding the threelac . - Jayden age:4 PDD_NOS
