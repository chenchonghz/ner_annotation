Has anyone tried supplementing with the serotonin l-tryptophan for anxiety relief . I 've had fairly good results with 250 mg before bedtime every few days ( with some vitamin C - I use magnesium ascorbate , 500 mg - to enhance conversion to serotonin instead of melatonin ) . I 've found studies showing that most kids with autism are serotonin deficient.Stephen
