I am hoping that everyone that has been doing Chelation ( of any type ) will post some updates here , we tried TTFD and Glutathione for 2 months with regression - gave it a rest and did a mixture of NAET/BioSET to eliminate allergies and help heal his immune system and are just now awaiting bloodworks results with the intent to start a suppository form of chelation . I am interested in all stories good or bad ! Thanks ! - Lynn - Mom to Dylan - Just turned 3 ( Somewhere on the Spectrum ) Doing Biomedical since Oct 07
