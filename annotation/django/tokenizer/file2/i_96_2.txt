Well crud . After about 10 nights of solid sleep , we went to the beach for a four night stay . Of course , out of the 5 suitcases of stuff I packed , the only thing missing was the kitchen sink and the MELATONIN . So , I went on a beach side mission to grocery stores and two drug stores at 830 at night to find chewable or sublingual stuff . Finally , I had to buy the pills you swallow . Cole chewed up the nasty tasting beast and went to sleep . At 440am , he was up ! The following afternoon , he of course passed out for a couple hours . No prob ... he 's had several two hour naps over the past couple months due to a new med , but the melatonin STILL would knock him out that same night . I managed to go to a GNC store and get the chewable Melatonin he 's used to , thinking the cheaper stuff was n't as potent . Foolish mortal ! It still did n't work ! He did n't go to sleep until after 3 in the morning . Same thing happened the following night and day . Either because we are gradually dosing down his Strattera or because he was at the beach and stimulated , it did n't work . Last night he was asleep by 1015 ( we allowed NO NAP ) and he was up at 6am . Keep your fingers crossed for us ! I got spoiled on sleeping 7 hours a night.- mom to Cole , 8 PDD NOS ( former 26 week preemie ) and Jack , 6 AOK
