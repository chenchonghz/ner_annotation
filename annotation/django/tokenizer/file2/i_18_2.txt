We are in the midst of it ( actually up to round 7 ) and recently had a Doctor 's Data Toxic Metal Challenge urine test ( our second one ) . Lauren 's levels of tin are coming down and now her lead is sky high . I was told to expect this as the lighter metals are decreasing but it is just frightening that my child is at a level of 66 for lead when the average is less than 5 . Truly lead poisoning and yet insurance is still not covering this . Anyone else experience this ? It makes me sick to my stomach seeing the levels of metals in her little body and wishing I could snap my fingers and make them just go away . I just think of all the damage that is occuring while we are trying to get rid of it . I am so glad that we are doing this . She is now at the point that she takes the oral syringe like a champ . I ca n't even get tylenol into her most times but she will drink this up for me ! I asked the pharmacist about this and he said that he 's seen a lot of this behavior ... it 's almost like they know that the DMSA is making them feel better so they want to take it . Anyway , just wanted to share a positive story.- I refuse to listen to the negative ignorance . I will give 100 % to helping her reach her maximum potential . She is special and will always be but she deserves more than complacency . Goodluck to all .
