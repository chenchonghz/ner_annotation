My son has ADHD and PDD-NOS . He is on the Daytrana patch and tenex . He has been taking tenex for almost 2 years . It can make a child sleepy in the beginning but this does not last . It really did n't seem to make my son sleepy at all . The doctor started him on .5 mg before bedtime after a week or two he added .5 mg in the morning . Now my son takes 1 mg in the morning and 1 mg in the evening . My son , before taking tenex was very easily frustrated and had anger issues . If he got upset he tended to have a meltdown or be in a miserable mood for hours . Since taking tenex he is not as easily frustrated and if he gets upset he does n't have a meltdown or stay angry for hours . His emotions seem to be much more even throughout the day . It does help with his hyperactivity and impulsivity too . I used to give him a short acting dose of focalin after school so we could get through homework and after school activities . Now he takes tenex instead . He does n't seem to have any side effects . The psych does do regular weight and blood pressure checks and orders an EKG yearly .
