Our son is taking 6 different medications . Two of them are for seizures-keppra and depakene . The depakene is processed ( or filtered ) through the liver . That is also where Tylenol is processed . We were told to given motrin to our son because the other way would be too much for the liver to handle . I am thinking that the Motrin is filtered through the kidneys .
