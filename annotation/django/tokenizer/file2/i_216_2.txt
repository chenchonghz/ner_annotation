In addition , recent evidence demonstrates that HBOT mobilizes stem cells from human bone marrow , which may aid symptoms in autistic individuals . Based on these findings , it is hypothesized that HBOT will improve symptoms in autistic individuals . ( Dr. Rossignol , Hyperbaric oxygen therapy might improve certain pathophysiological findings in autism , 2006 ) Hyperbaric oxygen treatment ( HBOT ) has been shown to increase oxygen perfusion , has potent anti-inflammatory effects , reduces oxidative stress and increases stem cell production . Studies have revealed that autism is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cerebral hypoperfusion , GI inflammation , and an increase in oxidative stress . Hypoperfusion is defined as & # 147 ; decreased blood flood through an organ , as in circulatory shock ; if prolonged , it may result in permanent cellular dysfunction and death & # 148 ; . Clinical studies involving PET ( Positive Emission Tomography ) scans have shown that upwards of 85 % of autistic children have decreased blood flow to the temporal regions of the brain , and that this hypoperfusion worsens as the child ages.This cerebral hypoperfusion in autistic children causes hypoxia ( a shortage of oxygen ) , which is believed to cause electrical failures in brain cells . Studies have shown that oxygen delivered by HBOT can reverse hypoxia in brain tissues caused by hypoperfusion . Some of these hypoxic brain cells have been described as & # 147 ; idling & # 148 ; because they remain alive but not functional . Restoration of oxygenation is believed to salvage these cells .
