Hi, My name is Jennifer, I have a 2 1/2 year old son with Autism Spectrum Disorder. He barely eats anything at all and practically lives on milk. I would love to hear more about chelation and the pros &amp; cons. Mason gets DHA everyday and a multivitamin but I would love to be doing more to help him.  Thanks Heidi- Jennifer
