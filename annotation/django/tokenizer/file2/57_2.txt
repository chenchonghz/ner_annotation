Do any of you have problem with your school nurse giving you children thier meds. Mine thinks she knows more than my childrens doctors. She will refuse to give him benadryl when he is upset even though it is prescribed by a doctor. She has sent notes home telling me she wants to know excatly what drugs chris is on because she feels as though they are not the right combo. I have talked to the principle but she tells me there is nothing she can do about it. Also last year this nurse would go the the elementary school witch is conneted to the middle school and talk about me with that staff. I have almost had enough of her.   Kathy
