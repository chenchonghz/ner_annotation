I posted this on the last 2 melatonin threads . There is information on side effects in it . http : //www.raysahelian.com/melatonin.html there is information about hormal effects on this link . This is when used every day . It says to use a couple of times a week not every day . You can also google melatonin side effect or melatonin hormone The main thing this study says is that in birds excess usage shrunk the gonads and likely to do the same in humans . This is why we do not use 2-3mg on my children . Quote : Melatonin research shows it may affect the sex glands . Tests on Japanese quail showed the hormone regulates a sexual pathway believed to be involved in seasonal breeding patterns . It is likely to affect human gonads as well . Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Bentley and colleagues at Hiroshima University in Japan said they were studying melatonin 's effects on a brain hormone called gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone , or GnIH . They removed all melatonin-producing organs from the birds - the eyes and the pineal glands - and found GnIH levels fell . When they gave the birds melatonin , levels of GnIH went back up . This is important because GnIH has been found to have the opposite effect to the key hormone that primes the body for sex - gonadotropin releasing hormone , or GnRH . In birds , switching off GnRH causes the gonads - the testes and ovary - to shrink as part of the birds ' yearly cycle . In humans , GnRH brings on puberty . it also says Quote : Melatonin and Children - Melatonin for children The use of melatonin for a child appears to be safe as long as melatonin use is kept to no more than 2 times a week and a dose of 0.5 mg or less . Further research with melatonin and children will tell us if more frequent use is appropriate or safe . Edited to add : Read the entire link not just what I posted . Much useful information on that link . Edited by SpainBound on January 31 2007 at 12:42pm
