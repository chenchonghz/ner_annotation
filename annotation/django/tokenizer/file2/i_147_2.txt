I think you 're right that soy might be a problem . Our naturopathic dr. said that many kids who ca n't tolerate milk also ca n't tolerate soy . It 's not the lactose ( milk sugar ) that 's a problem - it 's the casein ( milk protein ) . Kids with ASD may inherit a genetic problem digesting dairy protein , and the soy protein molecule is very similar to the dairy protein molecule . You might want to try almond milk or rice milk instead.- Mom to DD age 4-1/2 ASD , and DD age 18 months NT `` Difficult things take a long time , impossible things a little longer . '' ~Author Unknown
